    "response": "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called scattering, which occurs when sunlight interacts with the tiny molecules of gases in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nHere's what happens:\n\n1. Sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere and contains all the colors of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet).\n2. The shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are scattered more than the longer wavelengths by the tiny molecules of gases in the atmosphere, like nitrogen and oxygen.\n3. This scattering effect is more pronounced for shorter wavelengths because they have a smaller wavelength and are more easily deflected by the gas molecules.\n4. As a result, the blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from all directions.\n5. Our brains perceive this scattered blue light as the color of the sky.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century. It's also why the sun itself appears yellowish or orange to us, because our atmosphere scatters the shorter wavelengths of light and allows longer wavelengths (like red and orange) to reach our eyes.\n\nSo, to summarize: the sky appears blue because of the scattering effect caused by the tiny molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, which preferentially scatter shorter wavelengths of light, like blue and violet.",
