# Flink Architecture  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/flink-architecture/\#flink-architecture)

Flink is a distributed system and requires effective allocation and management
of compute resources in order to execute streaming applications. It integrates
with all common cluster resource managers such as [Hadoop\\
YARN](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html) and
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), but can also be set up to run as a
standalone cluster or even as a library.

This section contains an overview of Flink’s architecture and describes how its
main components interact to execute applications and recover from failures.

## Anatomy of a Flink Cluster  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/flink-architecture/\#anatomy-of-a-flink-cluster)

The Flink runtime consists of two types of processes: a _JobManager_ and one or more _TaskManagers_.

![The processes involved in executing a Flink dataflow](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/fig/processes.svg)

The _Client_ is not part of the runtime and program execution, but is used to
prepare and send a dataflow to the JobManager. After that, the client can
disconnect ( _detached mode_), or stay connected to receive progress reports
( _attached mode_). The client runs either as part of the Java program
that triggers the execution, or in the command line process `./bin/flink run ...`.

The JobManager and TaskManagers can be started in various ways: directly on
the machines as a [standalone cluster](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/deployment/resource-providers/standalone/overview/), in containers, or managed by resource
frameworks like [YARN](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/deployment/resource-providers/yarn/).
TaskManagers connect to JobManagers, announcing themselves as available, and
are assigned work.

### JobManager  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/flink-architecture/\#jobmanager)

The _JobManager_ has a number of responsibilities related to coordinating the distributed execution of Flink Applications:
it decides when to schedule the next task (or set of tasks), reacts to finished
tasks or execution failures, coordinates checkpoints, and coordinates recovery on
failures, among others. This process consists of three different components:

- **ResourceManager**

The _ResourceManager_ is responsible for resource de-/allocation and
provisioning in a Flink cluster — it manages **task slots**, which are the
unit of resource scheduling in a Flink cluster (see [TaskManagers](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/flink-architecture/#taskmanagers)).
Flink implements multiple ResourceManagers for different environments and
resource providers such as YARN, Kubernetes and standalone
deployments. In a standalone setup, the ResourceManager can only distribute
the slots of available TaskManagers and cannot start new TaskManagers on
its own.

- **Dispatcher**

The _Dispatcher_ provides a REST interface to submit Flink applications for
execution and starts a new JobMaster for each submitted job. It
also runs the Flink WebUI to provide information about job executions.

- **JobMaster**

A _JobMaster_ is responsible for managing the execution of a single
[JobGraph](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/glossary/#logical-graph).
Multiple jobs can run simultaneously in a Flink cluster, each having its
own JobMaster.


There is always at least one JobManager. A high-availability setup might have
multiple JobManagers, one of which is always the _leader_, and the others are
_standby_ (see [High Availability (HA)](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/deployment/ha/overview/)).

### TaskManagers  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/flink-architecture/\#taskmanagers)

The _TaskManagers_ (also called _workers_) execute the tasks of a dataflow, and buffer and exchange the data
streams.

There must always be at least one TaskManager. The smallest unit of resource scheduling in a TaskManager is a task _slot_. The number of task slots in a
TaskManager indicates the number of concurrent processing tasks. Note that
multiple operators may execute in a task slot (see [Tasks and Operator\\
Chains](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/flink-architecture/#tasks-and-operator-chains)).

## Tasks and Operator Chains  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/flink-architecture/\#tasks-and-operator-chains)

For distributed execution, Flink _chains_ operator subtasks together into
_tasks_. Each task is executed by one thread. Chaining operators together into
tasks is a useful optimization: it reduces the overhead of thread-to-thread
handover and buffering, and increases overall throughput while decreasing
latency. The chaining behavior can be configured; see the [chaining docs](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/overview/#task-chaining-and-resource-groups) for details.

The sample dataflow in the figure below is executed with five subtasks, and
hence with five parallel threads.

## Task Slots and Resources  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/flink-architecture/\#task-slots-and-resources)

Each worker (TaskManager) is a _JVM process_, and may execute one or more
subtasks in separate threads. To control how many tasks a TaskManager accepts, it
has so called **task slots** (at least one).

Each _task slot_ represents a fixed subset of resources of the TaskManager. A
TaskManager with three slots, for example, will dedicate 1/3 of its managed
memory to each slot. Slotting the resources means that a subtask will not
compete with subtasks from other jobs for managed memory, but instead has a
certain amount of reserved managed memory. Note that no CPU isolation happens
here; currently slots only separate the managed memory of tasks.

By adjusting the number of task slots, users can define how subtasks are
isolated from each other. Having one slot per TaskManager means that each task
group runs in a separate JVM (which can be started in a separate container, for
example). Having multiple slots means more subtasks share the same JVM. Tasks
in the same JVM share TCP connections (via multiplexing) and heartbeat
messages. They may also share data sets and data structures, thus reducing the
per-task overhead.

![A TaskManager with Task Slots and Tasks](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/fig/tasks_slots.svg)

By default, Flink allows subtasks to share slots even if they are subtasks of
different tasks, so long as they are from the same job. The result is that one
slot may hold an entire pipeline of the job. Allowing this _slot sharing_ has
two main benefits:

- A Flink cluster needs exactly as many task slots as the highest parallelism
used in the job. No need to calculate how many tasks (with varying
parallelism) a program contains in total.

- It is easier to get better resource utilization. Without slot sharing, the
non-intensive _source/map()_ subtasks would block as many resources as the
resource intensive _window_ subtasks. With slot sharing, increasing the
base parallelism in our example from two to six yields full utilization of
the slotted resources, while making sure that the heavy subtasks are fairly
distributed among the TaskManagers.

## Flink Application Execution  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/flink-architecture/\#flink-application-execution)

A _Flink Application_ is any user program that spawns one or multiple Flink
jobs from its `main()` method. The execution of these jobs can happen in a
local JVM (`LocalEnvironment`) or on a remote setup of clusters with multiple
machines (`RemoteEnvironment`). For each program, the `ExecutionEnvironment`
provides methods to control the job execution (e.g. setting the parallelism) and to interact with
the outside world (see [Anatomy of a Flink Program](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/overview/#anatomy-of-a-flink-program)).

The jobs of a Flink Application can either be submitted to a long-running
[Flink Session Cluster](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/glossary/#flink-session-cluster), a dedicated [Flink Job\\
Cluster (deprecated)](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/glossary/#flink-job-cluster), or a
[Flink Application Cluster](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/glossary/#flink-application-cluster). The difference between these options is mainly related to the cluster’s lifecycle and to resource
isolation guarantees.

### Flink Application Cluster  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/flink-architecture/\#flink-application-cluster)

- **Cluster Lifecycle**: a Flink Application Cluster is a dedicated Flink
cluster that only executes jobs from one Flink Application and where the
`main()` method runs on the cluster rather than the client. The job
submission is a one-step process: you don’t need to start a Flink cluster
first and then submit a job to the existing cluster session; instead, you
package your application logic and dependencies into a executable job JAR and
the cluster entrypoint (`ApplicationClusterEntryPoint`)
is responsible for calling the `main()` method to extract the JobGraph.
This allows you to deploy a Flink Application like any other application on
Kubernetes, for example. The lifetime of a Flink Application Cluster is
therefore bound to the lifetime of the Flink Application.

- **Resource Isolation**: in a Flink Application Cluster, the ResourceManager
and Dispatcher are scoped to a single Flink Application, which provides a
better separation of concerns than the Flink Session Cluster.


### Flink Session Cluster  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/flink-architecture/\#flink-session-cluster)

- **Cluster Lifecycle**: in a Flink Session Cluster, the client connects to a
pre-existing, long-running cluster that can accept multiple job submissions.
Even after all jobs are finished, the cluster (and the JobManager) will
keep running until the session is manually stopped. The lifetime of a Flink
Session Cluster is therefore not bound to the lifetime of any Flink Job.

- **Resource Isolation**: TaskManager slots are allocated by the
ResourceManager on job submission and released once the job is finished.
Because all jobs are sharing the same cluster, there is some competition for
cluster resources — like network bandwidth in the submit-job phase. One
limitation of this shared setup is that if one TaskManager crashes, then all
jobs that have tasks running on this TaskManager will fail; in a similar way, if
some fatal error occurs on the JobManager, it will affect all jobs running
in the cluster.

- **Other considerations**: having a pre-existing cluster saves a considerable
amount of time applying for resources and starting TaskManagers. This is
important in scenarios where the execution time of jobs is very short and a
high startup time would negatively impact the end-to-end user experience — as
is the case with interactive analysis of short queries, where it is desirable
that jobs can quickly perform computations using existing resources.
