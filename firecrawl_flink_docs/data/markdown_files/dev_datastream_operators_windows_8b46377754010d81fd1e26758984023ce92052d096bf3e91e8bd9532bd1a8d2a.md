# Windows  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#windows)

Windows are at the heart of processing infinite streams. Windows split the stream into “buckets” of finite size,
over which we can apply computations. This document focuses on how windowing is performed in Flink and how the
programmer can benefit to the maximum from its offered functionality.

The general structure of a windowed Flink program is presented below. The first snippet refers to _keyed_ streams,
while the second to _non-keyed_ ones. As one can see, the only difference is the `keyBy(...)` call for the keyed streams
and the `window(...)` which becomes `windowAll(...)` for non-keyed streams. This is also going to serve as a roadmap
for the rest of the page.

**Keyed Windows**

Java

```
stream
       .keyBy(...)               <-  keyed versus non-keyed windows
       .window(...)              <-  required: "assigner"
      [.trigger(...)]            <-  optional: "trigger" (else default trigger)
      [.evictor(...)]            <-  optional: "evictor" (else no evictor)
      [.allowedLateness(...)]    <-  optional: "lateness" (else zero)
      [.sideOutputLateData(...)] <-  optional: "output tag" (else no side output for late data)
       .reduce/aggregate/apply()      <-  required: "function"
      [.getSideOutput(...)]      <-  optional: "output tag"
```

Python

```
stream
       .key_by(...)
       .window(...)                 <-  required: "assigner"
      [.trigger(...)]               <-  optional: "trigger" (else default trigger)
      [.allowed_lateness(...)]      <-  optional: "lateness" (else zero)
      [.side_output_late_data(...)] <-  optional: "output tag" (else no side output for late data)
       .reduce/aggregate/apply()    <-  required: "function"
      [.get_side_output(...)]       <-  optional: "output tag"
```

**Non-Keyed Windows**

Java

```
stream
       .windowAll(...)           <-  required: "assigner"
      [.trigger(...)]            <-  optional: "trigger" (else default trigger)
      [.evictor(...)]            <-  optional: "evictor" (else no evictor)
      [.allowedLateness(...)]    <-  optional: "lateness" (else zero)
      [.sideOutputLateData(...)] <-  optional: "output tag" (else no side output for late data)
       .reduce/aggregate/apply()      <-  required: "function"
      [.getSideOutput(...)]      <-  optional: "output tag"
```

Python

```
stream
       .window_all(...)             <-  required: "assigner"
      [.trigger(...)]               <-  optional: "trigger" (else default trigger)
      [.allowed_lateness(...)]      <-  optional: "lateness" (else zero)
      [.side_output_late_data(...)] <-  optional: "output tag" (else no side output for late data)
       .reduce/aggregate/apply()    <-  required: "function"
      [.get_side_output(...)]       <-  optional: "output tag"
```

In the above, the commands in square brackets (\[…\]) are optional. This reveals that Flink allows you to customize your
windowing logic in many different ways so that it best fits your needs.

> Note: `Evictor` is still not supported in Python DataStream API.

## Window Lifecycle  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#window-lifecycle)

In a nutshell, a window is **created** as soon as the first element that should belong to this window arrives, and the
window is **completely removed** when the time (event or processing time) passes its end timestamp plus the user-specified
`allowed lateness` (see [Allowed Lateness](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#allowed-lateness)). Flink guarantees removal only for time-based
windows and not for other types, _e.g._ global windows (see [Window Assigners](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#window-assigners)). For example, with an
event-time-based windowing strategy that creates non-overlapping (or tumbling) windows every 5 minutes and has an allowed
lateness of 1 min, Flink will create a new window for the interval between `12:00` and `12:05` when the first element with
a timestamp that falls into this interval arrives, and it will remove it when the watermark passes the `12:06`
timestamp.

In addition, each window will have a `Trigger` (see [Triggers](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#triggers)) and a function (`ProcessWindowFunction`, `ReduceFunction`,
or `AggregateFunction`) (see [Window Functions](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#window-functions)) attached to it. The function will contain the computation to
be applied to the contents of the window, while the `Trigger` specifies the conditions under which the window is
considered ready for the function to be applied. A triggering policy might be something like “when the number of elements
in the window is more than 4”, or “when the watermark passes the end of the window”. A trigger can also decide to
purge a window’s contents any time between its creation and removal. Purging in this case only refers to the elements
in the window, and _not_ the window metadata. This means that new data can still be added to that window.

Apart from the above, you can specify an `Evictor` (see [Evictors](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#evictors)) which will be able to remove
elements from the window after the trigger fires and before and/or after the function is applied.

In the following we go into more detail for each of the components above. We start with the required parts in the above
snippet (see [Keyed vs Non-Keyed Windows](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#keyed-vs-non-keyed-windows), [Window Assigners](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#window-assigners), and
[Window Functions](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#window-functions)) before moving to the optional ones.

## Keyed vs Non-Keyed Windows  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#keyed-vs-non-keyed-windows)

The first thing to specify is whether your stream should be keyed or not. This has to be done before defining the window.
Using the `keyBy(...)` will split your infinite stream into logical keyed streams. If `keyBy(...)` is not called, your
stream is not keyed.

In the case of keyed streams, any attribute of your incoming events can be used as a key
(more details [here](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/state/#keyed-datastream)). Having a keyed stream will
allow your windowed computation to be performed in parallel by multiple tasks, as each logical keyed stream can be processed
independently from the rest. All elements referring to the same key will be sent to the same parallel task.

In case of non-keyed streams, your original stream will not be split into multiple logical streams and all the windowing logic
will be performed by a single task, _i.e._ with parallelism of 1.

## Window Assigners  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#window-assigners)

After specifying whether your stream is keyed or not, the next step is to define a _window assigner_.
The window assigner defines how elements are assigned to windows. This is done by specifying the `WindowAssigner`
of your choice in the `window(...)` (for _keyed_ streams) or the `windowAll()` (for _non-keyed_ streams) call.

A `WindowAssigner` is responsible for assigning each incoming element to one or more windows. Flink comes
with pre-defined window assigners for the most common use cases, namely _tumbling windows_,
_sliding windows_, _session windows_ and _global windows_. You can also implement a custom window assigner by
extending the `WindowAssigner` class. All built-in window assigners (except the global
windows) assign elements to windows based on time, which can either be processing time or event
time. Please take a look at our section on [event time](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/time/) to learn
about the difference between processing time and event time and how timestamps and watermarks are generated.

Time-based windows have a _start timestamp_ (inclusive) and an _end timestamp_ (exclusive)
that together describe the size of the window. In code, Flink uses `TimeWindow` when working with
time-based windows which has methods for querying the start- and end-timestamp and also an
additional method `maxTimestamp()` that returns the largest allowed timestamp for a given windows.

In the following, we show how Flink’s pre-defined window assigners work and how they are used
in a DataStream program. The following figures visualize the workings of each assigner. The purple circles
represent elements of the stream, which are partitioned by some key (in this case _user 1_, _user 2_ and _user 3_).
The x-axis shows the progress of time.

### Tumbling Windows  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#tumbling-windows)

A _tumbling windows_ assigner assigns each element to a window of a specified _window size_.
Tumbling windows have a fixed size and do not overlap. For example, if you specify a tumbling
window with a size of 5 minutes, the current window will be evaluated and a new window will be
started every five minutes as illustrated by the following figure.

![Tumbling Windows](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/fig/tumbling-windows.svg)

The following code snippets show how to use tumbling windows.

Java

```java
DataStream<T> input = ...;

// tumbling event-time windows
input
    .keyBy(<key selector>)
    .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofSeconds(5)))
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>);

// tumbling processing-time windows
input
    .keyBy(<key selector>)
    .window(TumblingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofSeconds(5)))
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>);

// daily tumbling event-time windows offset by -8 hours.
input
    .keyBy(<key selector>)
    .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofDays(1), Duration.ofHours(-8)))
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>);
```

Python

```python
input = ...  # type: DataStream

# tumbling event-time windows
input \
    .key_by(<key selector>) \
    .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofSeconds(5))) \
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>)

# tumbling processing-time windows
input \
    .key_by(<key selector>) \
    .window(TumblingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofSeconds(5))) \
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>)

# daily tumbling event-time windows offset by -8 hours.
input \
    .key_by(<key selector>) \
    .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofDays(1), Duration.ofHours(-8))) \
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>)
```

Time intervals can be specified by using one of `Duration.ofMillis(x)`, `Duration.ofSeconds(x)`,
`Duration.ofMinutes(x)`, and so on.

As shown in the last example, tumbling window assigners also take an optional `offset`
parameter that can be used to change the alignment of windows. For example, without offsets
hourly tumbling windows are aligned with epoch, that is you will get windows such as
`1:00:00.000 - 1:59:59.999`, `2:00:00.000 - 2:59:59.999` and so on. If you want to change
that you can give an offset. With an offset of 15 minutes you would, for example, get
`1:15:00.000 - 2:14:59.999`, `2:15:00.000 - 3:14:59.999` etc.
An important use case for offsets is to adjust windows to timezones other than UTC-0.
For example, in China you would have to specify an offset of `Duration.ofHours(-8)`.

### Sliding Windows  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#sliding-windows)

The _sliding windows_ assigner assigns elements to windows of fixed length. Similar to a tumbling
windows assigner, the size of the windows is configured by the _window size_ parameter.
An additional _window slide_ parameter controls how frequently a sliding window is started. Hence,
sliding windows can be overlapping if the slide is smaller than the window size. In this case elements
are assigned to multiple windows.

For example, you could have windows of size 10 minutes that slides by 5 minutes. With this you get every
5 minutes a window that contains the events that arrived during the last 10 minutes as depicted by the
following figure.

![sliding windows](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/fig/sliding-windows.svg)

The following code snippets show how to use sliding windows.

Java

```java
DataStream<T> input = ...;

// sliding event-time windows
input
    .keyBy(<key selector>)
    .window(SlidingEventTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofSeconds(10), Duration.ofSeconds(5)))
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>);

// sliding processing-time windows
input
    .keyBy(<key selector>)
    .window(SlidingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofSeconds(10), Duration.ofSeconds(5)))
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>);

// sliding processing-time windows offset by -8 hours
input
    .keyBy(<key selector>)
    .window(SlidingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofHours(12), Duration.ofHours(1), Duration.ofHours(-8)))
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>);
```

Python

```python
input = ...  # type: DataStream

# sliding event-time windows
input \
    .key_by(<key selector>) \
    .window(SlidingEventTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofSeconds(10), Duration.ofSeconds(5))) \
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>)

# sliding processing-time windows
input \
    .key_by(<key selector>) \
    .window(SlidingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofSeconds(10), Duration.ofSeconds(5))) \
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>)

# sliding processing-time windows offset by -8 hours
input \
    .key_by(<key selector>) \
    .window(SlidingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofHours(12), Duration.ofHours(1), Duration.ofHours(-8))) \
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>)
```

Time intervals can be specified by using one of `Duration.ofMillis(x)`, `Duration.ofSeconds(x)`,
`Duration.ofMinutes(x)`, and so on.

As shown in the last example, sliding window assigners also take an optional `offset` parameter
that can be used to change the alignment of windows. For example, without offsets hourly windows
sliding by 30 minutes are aligned with epoch, that is you will get windows such as
`1:00:00.000 - 1:59:59.999`, `1:30:00.000 - 2:29:59.999` and so on. If you want to change that
you can give an offset. With an offset of 15 minutes you would, for example, get
`1:15:00.000 - 2:14:59.999`, `1:45:00.000 - 2:44:59.999` etc.
An important use case for offsets is to adjust windows to timezones other than UTC-0.
For example, in China you would have to specify an offset of `Duration.ofHours(-8)`.

### Session Windows  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#session-windows)

The _session windows_ assigner groups elements by sessions of activity. Session windows do not overlap and
do not have a fixed start and end time, in contrast to _tumbling windows_ and _sliding windows_. Instead a
session window closes when it does not receive elements for a certain period of time, _i.e._, when a gap of
inactivity occurred. A session window assigner can be configured with either a static _session gap_ or with a
_session gap extractor_ function which defines how long the period of inactivity is. When this period expires,
the current session closes and subsequent elements are assigned to a new session window.

![session windows](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/fig/session-windows.svg)

The following code snippets show how to use session windows.

Java

```java
DataStream<T> input = ...;

// event-time session windows with static gap
input
    .keyBy(<key selector>)
    .window(EventTimeSessionWindows.withGap(Duration.ofMinutes(10)))
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>);

// event-time session windows with dynamic gap
input
    .keyBy(<key selector>)
    .window(EventTimeSessionWindows.withDynamicGap((element) -> {
        // determine and return session gap
    }))
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>);

// processing-time session windows with static gap
input
    .keyBy(<key selector>)
    .window(ProcessingTimeSessionWindows.withGap(Duration.ofMinutes(10)))
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>);

// processing-time session windows with dynamic gap
input
    .keyBy(<key selector>)
    .window(ProcessingTimeSessionWindows.withDynamicGap((element) -> {
        // determine and return session gap
    }))
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>);
```

Python

```python
input = ...  # type: DataStream

class MySessionWindowTimeGapExtractor(SessionWindowTimeGapExtractor):

    def extract(self, element: tuple) -> int:
        # determine and return session gap

# event-time session windows with static gap
input \
    .key_by(<key selector>) \
    .window(EventTimeSessionWindows.with_gap(Duration.ofMinutes(10))) \
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>)

# event-time session windows with dynamic gap
input \
    .key_by(<key selector>) \
    .window(EventTimeSessionWindows.with_dynamic_gap(MySessionWindowTimeGapExtractor())) \
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>)

# processing-time session windows with static gap
input \
    .key_by(<key selector>) \
    .window(ProcessingTimeSessionWindows.with_gap(Duration.ofMinutes(10))) \
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>)

# processing-time session windows with dynamic gap
input \
    .key_by(<key selector>) \
    .window(DynamicProcessingTimeSessionWindows.with_dynamic_gap(MySessionWindowTimeGapExtractor())) \
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>)
```

Static gaps can be specified by using one of `Duration.ofMillis(x)`, `Duration.ofSeconds(x)`,
`Duration.ofMinutes(x)`, and so on.

Dynamic gaps are specified by implementing the `SessionWindowTimeGapExtractor` interface.

> Since session windows do not have a fixed start and end,
> they are evaluated differently than tumbling and sliding windows. Internally, a session window operator
> creates a new window for each arriving record and merges windows together if they are closer to each other
> than the defined gap.
> In order to be mergeable, a session window operator requires a merging [Trigger](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#triggers) and a merging
> [Window Function](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#window-functions), such as `ReduceFunction`, `AggregateFunction`, or `ProcessWindowFunction`

### Global Windows  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#global-windows)

A _global windows_ assigner assigns all elements with the same key to the same single _global window_.
This windowing scheme is only useful if you also specify a custom [trigger](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#triggers). Otherwise,
no computation will be performed, as the global window does not have a natural end at
which we could process the aggregated elements.

![global windows](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/fig/non-windowed.svg)

The following code snippets show how to use a global window.

Java

```java
DataStream<T> input = ...;

input
    .keyBy(<key selector>)
    .window(GlobalWindows.create())
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>);
```

Python

```python
input = ...  # type: DataStream

input \
    .key_by(<key selector>) \
    .window(GlobalWindows.create()) \
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>)
```

## Window Functions  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#window-functions)

After defining the window assigner, we need to specify the computation that we want
to perform on each of these windows. This is the responsibility of the _window function_, which is used to process the
elements of each (possibly keyed) window once the system determines that a window is ready for processing
(see [triggers](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#triggers) for how Flink determines when a window is ready).

The window function can be one of `ReduceFunction`, `AggregateFunction`, or `ProcessWindowFunction`. The first
two can be executed more efficiently (see [State Size](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#useful-state-size-considerations) section) because Flink can incrementally aggregate
the elements for each window as they arrive. A `ProcessWindowFunction` gets an `Iterable` for all the elements contained in a
window and additional meta information about the window to which the elements belong.

A windowed transformation with a `ProcessWindowFunction` cannot be executed as efficiently as the other
cases because Flink has to buffer _all_ elements for a window internally before invoking the function.
This can be mitigated by combining a `ProcessWindowFunction` with a `ReduceFunction`, or `AggregateFunction` to
get both incremental aggregation of window elements and the additional window metadata that the
`ProcessWindowFunction` receives. We will look at examples for each of these variants.

### ReduceFunction  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#reducefunction)

A `ReduceFunction` specifies how two elements from the input are combined to produce
an output element of the same type. Flink uses a `ReduceFunction` to incrementally aggregate
the elements of a window.

A `ReduceFunction` can be defined and used like this:

Java

```java
DataStream<Tuple2<String, Long>> input = ...;

input
    .keyBy(<key selector>)
    .window(<window assigner>)
    .reduce(new ReduceFunction<Tuple2<String, Long>>() {
      public Tuple2<String, Long> reduce(Tuple2<String, Long> v1, Tuple2<String, Long> v2) {
        return new Tuple2<>(v1.f0, v1.f1 + v2.f1);
      }
    });
```

The above example sums up the second fields of the tuples for all elements in a window.

### AggregateFunction  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#aggregatefunction)

An `AggregateFunction` is a generalized version of a `ReduceFunction` that has three types: an
input type (`IN`), accumulator type (`ACC`), and an output type (`OUT`). The input type is the type
of elements in the input stream and the `AggregateFunction` has a method for adding one input
element to an accumulator. The interface also has methods for creating an initial accumulator,
for merging two accumulators into one accumulator and for extracting an output (of type `OUT`) from
an accumulator. We will see how this works in the example below.

Same as with `ReduceFunction`, Flink will incrementally aggregate input elements of a window as they
arrive.

An `AggregateFunction` can be defined and used like this:

Java

```java

/**
 * The accumulator is used to keep a running sum and a count. The {@code getResult} method
 * computes the average.
 */
private static class AverageAggregate
    implements AggregateFunction<Tuple2<String, Long>, Tuple2<Long, Long>, Double> {
  @Override
  public Tuple2<Long, Long> createAccumulator() {
    return new Tuple2<>(0L, 0L);
  }

  @Override
  public Tuple2<Long, Long> add(Tuple2<String, Long> value, Tuple2<Long, Long> accumulator) {
    return new Tuple2<>(accumulator.f0 + value.f1, accumulator.f1 + 1L);
  }

  @Override
  public Double getResult(Tuple2<Long, Long> accumulator) {
    return ((double) accumulator.f0) / accumulator.f1;
  }

  @Override
  public Tuple2<Long, Long> merge(Tuple2<Long, Long> a, Tuple2<Long, Long> b) {
    return new Tuple2<>(a.f0 + b.f0, a.f1 + b.f1);
  }
}

DataStream<Tuple2<String, Long>> input = ...;

input
    .keyBy(<key selector>)
    .window(<window assigner>)
    .aggregate(new AverageAggregate());
```

Python

```python
class AverageAggregate(AggregateFunction):

    def create_accumulator(self) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        return 0, 0

    def add(self, value: Tuple[str, int], accumulator: Tuple[int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        return accumulator[0] + value[1], accumulator[1] + 1

    def get_result(self, accumulator: Tuple[int, int]) -> float:
        return accumulator[0] / accumulator[1]

    def merge(self, a: Tuple[int, int], b: Tuple[int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        return a[0] + b[0], a[1] + b[1]

input = ...  # type: DataStream

input \
    .key_by(<key selector>) \
    .window(<window assigner>) \
    .aggregate(AverageAggregate(),
               accumulator_type=Types.TUPLE([Types.LONG(), Types.LONG()]),
               output_type=Types.DOUBLE())
```

The above example computes the average of the second field of the elements in the window.

### ProcessWindowFunction  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#processwindowfunction)

A ProcessWindowFunction gets an Iterable containing all the elements of the window, and a Context
object with access to time and state information, which enables it to provide more flexibility than
other window functions. This comes at the cost of performance and resource consumption, because
elements cannot be incrementally aggregated but instead need to be buffered internally until the
window is considered ready for processing.

The signature of `ProcessWindowFunction` looks as follows:

Java

```java
public abstract class ProcessWindowFunction<IN, OUT, KEY, W extends Window> implements Function {

    /**
     * Evaluates the window and outputs none or several elements.
     *
     * @param key The key for which this window is evaluated.
     * @param context The context in which the window is being evaluated.
     * @param elements The elements in the window being evaluated.
     * @param out A collector for emitting elements.
     *
     * @throws Exception The function may throw exceptions to fail the program and trigger recovery.
     */

The `key` parameter is the key that is extracted
via the `KeySelector` that was specified for the `keyBy()` invocation. In case of tuple-index
keys or string-field references this key type is always `Tuple` and you have to manually cast
it to a tuple of the correct size to extract the key fields.

A `ProcessWindowFunction` can be defined and used like this:

Java

```java
DataStream<Tuple2<String, Long>> input = ...;

input
  .keyBy(t -> t.f0)
  .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofMinutes(5)))
  .process(new MyProcessWindowFunction());

/* ... */

public class MyProcessWindowFunction
    extends ProcessWindowFunction<Tuple2<String, Long>, String, String, TimeWindow> {

  @Override
  public void process(String key, Context context, Iterable<Tuple2<String, Long>> input, Collector<String> out) {
    long count = 0;
    for (Tuple2<String, Long> in: input) {
      count++;
    }
    out.collect("Window: " + context.window() + "count: " + count);
  }
}
```

Python

```python
input = ...  # type: DataStream

input \
    .key_by(lambda v: v[0]) \
    .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofMinutes(5))) \
    .process(MyProcessWindowFunction())

# ...

class MyProcessWindowFunction(ProcessWindowFunction):

    def process(self, key: str, context: ProcessWindowFunction.Context,
                elements: Iterable[Tuple[str, int]]) -> Iterable[str]:
        count = 0
        for _ in elements:
            count += 1
        yield "Window: {} count: {}".format(context.window(), count)
```

The example shows a `ProcessWindowFunction` that counts the elements in a window. In addition, the window function adds information about the window to the output.

> Note that using `ProcessWindowFunction` for simple aggregates such as count is quite inefficient. The next section shows how a `ReduceFunction` or `AggregateFunction` can be combined with a `ProcessWindowFunction` to get both incremental aggregation and the added information of a `ProcessWindowFunction`.

### ProcessWindowFunction with Incremental Aggregation  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#processwindowfunction-with-incremental-aggregation)

A `ProcessWindowFunction` can be combined with either a `ReduceFunction`, or an `AggregateFunction` to
incrementally aggregate elements as they arrive in the window.
When the window is closed, the `ProcessWindowFunction` will be provided with the aggregated result.
This allows it to incrementally compute windows while having access to the
additional window meta information of the `ProcessWindowFunction`.

You can also use the legacy `WindowFunction` instead of `ProcessWindowFunction` for incremental window aggregation.

#### Incremental Window Aggregation with ReduceFunction  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#incremental-window-aggregation-with-reducefunction)

The following example shows how an incremental `ReduceFunction` can be combined with
a `ProcessWindowFunction` to return the smallest event in a window along
with the start time of the window.

Java

```java
DataStream<SensorReading> input = ...;

input
  .keyBy(<key selector>)
  .window(<window assigner>)
  .reduce(new MyReduceFunction(), new MyProcessWindowFunction());

// Function definitions

private static class MyReduceFunction implements ReduceFunction<SensorReading> {

  public SensorReading reduce(SensorReading r1, SensorReading r2) {
      return r1.value() > r2.value() ? r2 : r1;
  }
}

private static class MyProcessWindowFunction
    extends ProcessWindowFunction<SensorReading, Tuple2<Long, SensorReading>, String, TimeWindow> {

  public void process(String key,
                    Context context,
                    Iterable<SensorReading> minReadings,
                    Collector<Tuple2<Long, SensorReading>> out) {
      SensorReading min = minReadings.iterator().next();
      out.collect(new Tuple2<Long, SensorReading>(context.window().getStart(), min));
  }
}
```

Python

```python
input = ...  # type: DataStream

input \
    .key_by(<key selector>) \
    .window(<window assigner>) \
    .reduce(lambda r1, r2: r2 if r1.value > r2.value else r1,
            window_function=MyProcessWindowFunction(),
            output_type=Types.TUPLE([Types.STRING(), Types.LONG()]))

# Function definition

class MyProcessWindowFunction(ProcessWindowFunction):

    def process(self, key: str, context: ProcessWindowFunction.Context,
                min_readings: Iterable[SensorReading]) -> Iterable[Tuple[int, SensorReading]]:
        min = next(iter(min_readings))
        yield context.window().start, min
```

#### Incremental Window Aggregation with AggregateFunction  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#incremental-window-aggregation-with-aggregatefunction)

The following example shows how an incremental `AggregateFunction` can be combined with
a `ProcessWindowFunction` to compute the average and also emit the key and window along with
the average.

Java

```java
DataStream<Tuple2<String, Long>> input = ...;

input
  .keyBy(<key selector>)
  .window(<window assigner>)
  .aggregate(new AverageAggregate(), new MyProcessWindowFunction());

// Function definitions

/**

 */
private static class AverageAggregate
    implements AggregateFunction<Tuple2<String, Long>, Tuple2<Long, Long>, Double> {
  @Override
  public Tuple2<Long, Long> createAccumulator() {
    return new Tuple2<>(0L, 0L);
  }

  @Override
  public Tuple2<Long, Long> add(Tuple2<String, Long> value, Tuple2<Long, Long> accumulator) {
    return new Tuple2<>(accumulator.f0 + value.f1, accumulator.f1 + 1L);
  }

  @Override
  public Double getResult(Tuple2<Long, Long> accumulator) {
    return ((double) accumulator.f0) / accumulator.f1;
  }

  @Override
  public Tuple2<Long, Long> merge(Tuple2<Long, Long> a, Tuple2<Long, Long> b) {
    return new Tuple2<>(a.f0 + b.f0, a.f1 + b.f1);
  }
}

private static class MyProcessWindowFunction
    extends ProcessWindowFunction<Double, Tuple2<String, Double>, String, TimeWindow> {

  public void process(String key,
                    Context context,
                    Iterable<Double> averages,
                    Collector<Tuple2<String, Double>> out) {
      Double average = averages.iterator().next();
      out.collect(new Tuple2<>(key, average));
  }
}
```

```python
input = ...  # type: DataStream

### Using per-window state in ProcessWindowFunction  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#using-per-window-state-in-processwindowfunction)

In addition to accessing keyed state (as any rich function can) a `ProcessWindowFunction` can
also use keyed state that is scoped to the window that the function is currently processing. In this
context it is important to understand what the window that _per-window_ state is referring to is.
There are different “windows” involved:

- The window that was defined when specifying the windowed operation: This might be _tumbling_
_windows of 1 hour_ or _sliding windows of 2 hours that slide by 1 hour_.
- An actual instance of a defined window for a given key: This might be _time window from 12:00_
_to 13:00 for user-id xyz_. This is based on the window definition and there will be many windows
based on the number of keys that the job is currently processing and based on what time slots
the events fall into.

Per-window state is tied to the latter of those two. Meaning that if we process events for 1000
different keys and events for all of them currently fall into the _\[12:00, 13:00)_ time window\
then there will be 1000 window instances that each have their own keyed per-window state.\
\
There are two methods on the `Context` object that a `process()` invocation receives that allow\
access to the two types of state:\
\
- `globalState()`, which allows access to keyed state that is not scoped to a window\
- `windowState()`, which allows access to keyed state that is also scoped to the window\
\
This feature is helpful if you anticipate multiple firing for the same window, as can happen when\
you have late firings for data that arrives late or when you have a custom trigger that does\
speculative early firings. In such a case you would store information about previous firings or\
the number of firings in per-window state.\
\
When using windowed state it is important to also clean up that state when a window is cleared. This\
should happen in the `clear()` method.\
\
### WindowFunction (Legacy)  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#windowfunction-legacy)\
\
In some places where a `ProcessWindowFunction` can be used you can also use a `WindowFunction`. This\
is an older version of `ProcessWindowFunction` that provides less contextual information and does\
not have some advances features, such as per-window keyed state. This interface will be deprecated\
at some point.\
\
The signature of a `WindowFunction` looks as follows:\
\
Java\
\
```java\
public interface WindowFunction<IN, OUT, KEY, W extends Window> extends Function, Serializable {\
\
  /**\
   * Evaluates the window and outputs none or several elements.\
   *\
   * @param key The key for which this window is evaluated.\
   * @param window The window that is being evaluated.\
   * @param input The elements in the window being evaluated.\
   * @param out A collector for emitting elements.\
   *\
   * @throws Exception The function may throw exceptions to fail the program and trigger recovery.\
   */\
  void apply(KEY key, W window, Iterable<IN> input, Collector<OUT> out) throws Exception;\
}\
```\
\
Python\
\
```python\
class WindowFunction(Function, Generic[IN, OUT, KEY, W]):\
\
    @abstractmethod\
    def apply(self, key: KEY, window: W, inputs: Iterable[IN]) -> Iterable[OUT]:\
        """\
        Evaluates the window and outputs none or several elements.\
\
        :param key: The key for which this window is evaluated.\
        :param window: The window that is being evaluated.\
        :param inputs: The elements in the window being evaluated.\
        """\
        pass\
```\
\
It can be used like this:\
\
Java\
\
```java\
DataStream<Tuple2<String, Long>> input = ...;\
\
input\
    .keyBy(<key selector>)\
    .window(<window assigner>)\
    .apply(new MyWindowFunction());\
```\
\
Python\
\
```python\
input = ...  # type: DataStream\
\
input \\
    .key_by(<key selector>) \\
    .window(<window assigner>) \\
    .apply(MyWindowFunction())\
```\
\
## Triggers  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#triggers)\
\
A `Trigger` determines when a window (as formed by the _window assigner_) is ready to be\
processed by the _window function_. Each `WindowAssigner` comes with a default `Trigger`.\
If the default trigger does not fit your needs, you can specify a custom trigger using `trigger(...)`.\
\
The trigger interface has five methods that allow a `Trigger` to react to different events:\
\
- The `onElement()` method is called for each element that is added to a window.\
- The `onEventTime()` method is called when a registered event-time timer fires.\
- The `onProcessingTime()` method is called when a registered processing-time timer fires.\
- The `onMerge()` method is relevant for stateful triggers and merges the states of two triggers when their corresponding windows merge, _e.g._ when using session windows.\
- Finally the `clear()` method performs any action needed upon removal of the corresponding window.\
\
Two things to notice about the above methods are:\
\
1. The first three decide how to act on their invocation event by returning a `TriggerResult`. The action can be one of the following:\
\
- `CONTINUE`: do nothing,\
- `FIRE`: trigger the computation,\
- `PURGE`: clear the elements in the window, and\
- `FIRE_AND_PURGE`: trigger the computation and clear the elements in the window afterwards.\
\
2. Any of these methods can be used to register processing- or event-time timers for future actions.\
\
### Fire and Purge  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#fire-and-purge)\
\
Once a trigger determines that a window is ready for processing, it fires, _i.e._, it returns `FIRE` or `FIRE_AND_PURGE`. This is the signal for the window operator\
to emit the result of the current window. Given a window with a `ProcessWindowFunction`\
all elements are passed to the `ProcessWindowFunction` (possibly after passing them to an evictor).\
Windows with `ReduceFunction`, or `AggregateFunction` simply emit their eagerly aggregated result.\
\
When a trigger fires, it can either `FIRE` or `FIRE_AND_PURGE`. While `FIRE` keeps the contents of the window, `FIRE_AND_PURGE` removes its content.\
By default, the pre-implemented triggers simply `FIRE` without purging the window state.\
\
> Purging will simply remove the contents of the window and will leave any potential meta-information about the window and any trigger state intact.\
\
### Default Triggers of WindowAssigners  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#default-triggers-of-windowassigners)\
\
The default `Trigger` of a `WindowAssigner` is appropriate for many use cases. For example, all the event-time window assigners have an `EventTimeTrigger` as\
default trigger. This trigger simply fires once the watermark passes the end of a window.\
\
The default trigger of the `GlobalWindow` is the `NeverTrigger` which does never fire. Consequently, you always have to define a custom trigger when using a `GlobalWindow`.\
\
> By specifying a trigger using `trigger()` you\
> are overwriting the default trigger of a `WindowAssigner`. For example, if you specify a\
> `CountTrigger` for `TumblingEventTimeWindows` you will no longer get window firings based on the\
> progress of time but only by count. Right now, you have to write your own custom trigger if\
> you want to react based on both time and count.\
\
### Built-in and Custom Triggers  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#built-in-and-custom-triggers)\
\
Flink comes with a few built-in triggers.\
\
- The (already mentioned) `EventTimeTrigger` fires based on the progress of event-time as measured by watermarks.\
- The `ProcessingTimeTrigger` fires based on processing time.\
- The `CountTrigger` fires once the number of elements in a window exceeds the given limit.\
- The `PurgingTrigger` takes as argument another trigger and transforms it into a purging one.\
\
If you need to implement a custom trigger, you should check out the abstract\
\
[Trigger](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-2.2//flink-streaming-java/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/windowing/triggers/Trigger.java)\
class.\
Please note that the API is still evolving and might change in future versions of Flink.\
\
## Evictors  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#evictors)\
\
Flink’s windowing model allows specifying an optional `Evictor` in addition to the `WindowAssigner` and the `Trigger`.\
This can be done using the `evictor(...)` method (shown in the beginning of this document). The evictor has the ability\
to remove elements from a window _after_ the trigger fires and _before and/or after_ the window function is applied.\
To do so, the `Evictor` interface has two methods:\
\
```\
/**\
 * Optionally evicts elements. Called before windowing function.\
 *\
 * @param elements The elements currently in the pane.\
 * @param size The current number of elements in the pane.\
 * @param window The {@link Window}\
 * @param evictorContext The context for the Evictor\
 */\
void evictBefore(Iterable<TimestampedValue<T>> elements, int size, W window, EvictorContext evictorContext);\
\
/**\
 * Optionally evicts elements. Called after windowing function.\
 *\
 * @param elements The elements currently in the pane.\
 * @param size The current number of elements in the pane.\
 * @param window The {@link Window}\
 * @param evictorContext The context for the Evictor\
 */\
void evictAfter(Iterable<TimestampedValue<T>> elements, int size, W window, EvictorContext evictorContext);\
```\
\
The `evictBefore()` contains the eviction logic to be applied before the window function, while the `evictAfter()`\
contains the one to be applied after the window function. Elements evicted before the application of the window\
function will not be processed by it.\
\
Flink comes with three pre-implemented evictors. These are:\
\
- `CountEvictor`: keeps up to a user-specified number of elements from the window and discards the remaining ones from\
the beginning of the window buffer.\
- `DeltaEvictor`: takes a `DeltaFunction` and a `threshold`, computes the delta between the last element in the\
window buffer and each of the remaining ones, and removes the ones with a delta greater or equal to the threshold.\
- `TimeEvictor`: takes as argument an `interval` in milliseconds and for a given window, it finds the maximum\
timestamp `max_ts` among its elements and removes all the elements with timestamps smaller than `max_ts - interval`.\
\
By default, all the pre-implemented evictors apply their logic before the window function.\
\
> Specifying an evictor prevents any pre-aggregation, as all the\
> elements of a window have to be passed to the evictor before applying the computation.\
> This means windows with evictors will create significantly more state.\
\
> Note: `Evictor` is still not supported in Python DataStream API.\
\
Flink provides no guarantees about the order of the elements within\
a window. This implies that although an evictor may remove elements from the beginning of the window, these are not\
necessarily the ones that arrive first or last.\
\
## Allowed Lateness  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#allowed-lateness)\
\
When working with _event-time_ windowing, it can happen that elements arrive late, _i.e._ the watermark that Flink uses to\
keep track of the progress of event-time is already past the end timestamp of a window to which an element belongs. See\
[event time](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/event-time/generating_watermarks/) and especially [late elements](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/event-time/generating_watermarks/#late-elements) for a more thorough\
discussion of how Flink deals with event time.\
\
By default, late elements are dropped when the watermark is past the end of the window. However,\
Flink allows to specify a maximum _allowed lateness_ for window operators. Allowed lateness\
specifies by how much time elements can be late before they are dropped, and its default value is 0.\
Elements that arrive after the watermark has passed the end of the window but before it passes the end of\
the window plus the allowed lateness, are still added to the window. Depending on the trigger used,\
a late but not dropped element may cause the window to fire again. This is the case for the `EventTimeTrigger`.\
\
In order to make this work, Flink keeps the state of windows until their allowed lateness expires. Once this happens, Flink removes the window and deletes its state, as\
also described in the [Window Lifecycle](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#window-lifecycle) section.\
\
By default, the allowed lateness is set to `0`. That is, elements that arrive behind the watermark will be dropped.\
\
You can specify an allowed lateness like this:\
\
Java\
\
```java\
DataStream<T> input = ...;\

### Getting late data as a side output  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#getting-late-data-as-a-side-output)\
\
Using Flink’s [side output](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/side_output/) feature you can get a stream of the data\
that was discarded as late.\
\
You first need to specify that you want to get late data using `sideOutputLateData(OutputTag)` on\
the windowed stream. Then, you can get the side-output stream on the result of the windowed\
operation:\
\
Java\
\
```java\
final OutputTag<T> lateOutputTag = new OutputTag<T>("late-data"){};\
\
DataStream<T> input = ...;\
\
SingleOutputStreamOperator<T> result = input\
    .keyBy(<key selector>)\
    .window(<window assigner>)\
    .allowedLateness(<time>)\
    .sideOutputLateData(lateOutputTag)\
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>);\
\
DataStream<T> lateStream = result.getSideOutput(lateOutputTag);\
```\
\
Python\
\
```python\
late_output_tag = OutputTag("late-data", type_info)\
\
input = ...  # type: DataStream\
\
result = input \\
    .key_by(<key selector>) \\
    .window(<window assigner>) \\
    .allowed_lateness(<time>) \\
    .side_output_late_data(late_output_tag) \\
    .<windowed transformation>(<window function>)\
\
late_stream = result.get_side_output(late_output_tag)\
```\

### Late elements considerations  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#late-elements-considerations)\
\
When specifying an allowed lateness greater than 0, the window along with its content is kept after the watermark passes\
the end of the window. In these cases, when a late but not dropped element arrives, it could trigger another firing for the\
window. These firings are called `late firings`, as they are triggered by late events and in contrast to the `main firing`\
which is the first firing of the window. In case of session windows, late firings can further lead to merging of windows,\
as they may “bridge” the gap between two pre-existing, unmerged windows.\
\
> The elements emitted by a late firing should be treated as updated results of a previous computation, i.e., your data stream will contain multiple results for the same computation. Depending on your application, you need to take these duplicated results into account or deduplicate them.\
\
## Working with window results  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#working-with-window-results)\
\
The result of a windowed operation is again a `DataStream`, no information about the windowed\
operations is retained in the result elements so if you want to keep meta-information about the\
window you have to manually encode that information in the result elements in your\
`ProcessWindowFunction`. The only relevant information that is set on the result elements is the\
element _timestamp_. This is set to the maximum allowed timestamp of the processed window, which\
is _end timestamp - 1_, since the window-end timestamp is exclusive. Note that this is true for both\
event-time windows and processing-time windows. i.e. after a windowed operations elements always\
have a timestamp, but this can be an event-time timestamp or a processing-time timestamp. For\
processing-time windows this has no special implications but for event-time windows this together\
with how watermarks interact with windows enables\
[consecutive windowed operations](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#consecutive-windowed-operations) with the same window sizes. We\
will cover this after taking a look how watermarks interact with windows.\
\
### Interaction of watermarks and windows  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#interaction-of-watermarks-and-windows)\
\
Before continuing in this section you might want to take a look at our section about\
[event time and watermarks](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/concepts/time/).\
\
When watermarks arrive at the window operator this triggers two things:\
\
- the watermark triggers computation of all windows where the maximum timestamp (which is\
_end-timestamp - 1_) is smaller than the new watermark\
- the watermark is forwarded (as is) to downstream operations\
\
Intuitively, a watermark “flushes” out any windows that would be considered late in downstream\
operations once they receive that watermark.\
\
### Consecutive windowed operations  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#consecutive-windowed-operations)\
\
As mentioned before, the way the timestamp of windowed results is computed and how watermarks\
interact with windows allows stringing together consecutive windowed operations. This can be useful\
when you want to do two consecutive windowed operations where you want to use different keys but\
still want elements from the same upstream window to end up in the same downstream window. Consider\
this example:\
\
Java\
\
```java\
DataStream<Integer> input = ...;\
\
DataStream<Integer> resultsPerKey = input\
    .keyBy(<key selector>)\
    .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofSeconds(5)))\
    .reduce(new Summer());\
\
DataStream<Integer> globalResults = resultsPerKey\
    .windowAll(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofSeconds(5)))\
    .process(new TopKWindowFunction());\
```\
\
Python\
\
```python\
input = ...  # type: DataStream\
\
results_per_key = input \\
    .key_by(<key selector>) \\
    .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofSeconds(5))) \\
    .reduce(Summer())\
\
global_results = results_per_key \\
    .window_all(TumblingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofSeconds(5))) \\
    .process(TopKWindowFunction())\
```\
\
In this example, the results for time window `[0, 5)` from the first operation will also end up in\
time window `[0, 5)` in the subsequent windowed operation. This allows calculating a sum per key\
and then calculating the top-k elements within the same window in the second operation.\
\
## Useful state size considerations  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/\#useful-state-size-considerations)\
\
Windows can be defined over long periods of time (such as days, weeks, or months) and therefore accumulate very large state. There are a couple of rules to keep in mind when estimating the storage requirements of your windowing computation:\
\
1. Flink creates one copy of each element per window to which it belongs. Given this, tumbling windows keep one copy of each element (an element belongs to exactly one window unless it is dropped late). In contrast, sliding windows create several of each element, as explained in the [Window Assigners](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#window-assigners) section. Hence, a sliding window of size 1 day and slide 1 second might not be a good idea.\
\
2. `ReduceFunction` and `AggregateFunction` can significantly reduce the storage requirements, as they eagerly aggregate elements and store only one value per window. In contrast, just using a `ProcessWindowFunction` requires accumulating all elements.\
\
3. Using an `Evictor` prevents any pre-aggregation, as all the elements of a window have to be passed through the evictor before applying the computation (see [Evictors](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/operators/windows/#evictors)).
