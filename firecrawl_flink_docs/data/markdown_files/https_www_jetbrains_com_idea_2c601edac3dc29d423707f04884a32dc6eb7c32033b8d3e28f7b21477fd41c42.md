## What's new

### Command completion

Forget about shortcuts and use code native patterns to harness the power of your favorite IDE! To help keep you in the flow, IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 introduces command completion – a new way to access context-aware actions directly from code completion.

- Type `.` to see code completion and postfix completion suggestions, as well as actions.
- Type `..` to filter the results to actions only.
- Select an action to see the exact context and preview what the action will do if applied.

This refinement makes development more comfortable and efficient, as you no longer need to decide between multiple ways to find and invoke actions in a given situation.

For details, check out the [blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2025/11/universal-entry-point-a-single-entry-point-for-context-aware-coding-assistance/).

### Spring Boot 4 and Spring Framework 7 Ultimate

IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 helps you stay at the cutting edge of development in the Spring ecosystem. First-class support for the latest improvements in Spring Framework 7 and Spring Boot 4 simplifies application development while also reducing friction in your developer experience. Improvements to REST API versioning, programmatic bean registration, and declarative HTTP service clients keep you in the flow and focused on your most important tasks, rather than stuck with setup.

### Spring Debugger updates Ultimate

The Spring Debugger plugin now has over 250,000 users, and your feedback has allowed us to continue improving it to help you better understand what's happening inside your Spring applications. Right after the plugin's release, the top question was "Can I debug remote applications?" We're now happy to say that the answer is: "Absolutely!" Simply start your app with a debug port open, and then attach from the IDE. That's it – you're all set.

We've also added another highly anticipated feature: IntelliJ IDEA can now automatically connect to your database when the application starts.

Make sure to update your Spring Debugger plugin to the latest version to get these improvements and other fixes.

### Java 25

Released in September 2025, Java 25 is the next Long-Term Support (LTS) version of the Java platform. IntelliJ IDEA has supported Java 25 from day one of its release, ensuring developers could immediately benefit from the latest language, runtime, and tooling enhancements.

In this release, we are adding the finishing touches to this support – making sure all bundled tools and libraries, including Async Profiler 4.1 and JaCoCo, are compatible with Java 25 runtimes.

JDK 25 builds from all major vendors – Oracle OpenJDK, IBM Semeru J9, GraalVM, and Microsoft Build of OpenJDK – are available for download directly from IntelliJ IDEA.

For details about the features and improvements introduced between Java 21 and Java 25, check out this detailed [blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2025/09/java-25-lts-and-intellij-idea/).
