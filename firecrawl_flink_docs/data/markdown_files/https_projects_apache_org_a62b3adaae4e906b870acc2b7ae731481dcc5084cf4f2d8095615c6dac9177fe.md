## Welcome to the Apache Projects and Committees Directory

This site is a partial (\*) catalog of Apache Software Foundation [projects](https://projects.apache.org/projects.html) and their [management committees](https://projects.apache.org/committees.html).
It is designed to help you find specific projects that meet your interests and to gain a broader understanding of
the wide variety of work currently underway in the Apache community.


(\*) Please note that some committees have [not yet provided data](https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?category#no-tlp-doap) for the projects that they manage.
