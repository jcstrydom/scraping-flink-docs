# Table API & SQL  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/dev/table/overview/\#table-api--sql)

Apache Flink features two relational APIs - the Table API and SQL - for unified stream and batch
processing. The Table API is a language-integrated query API for Java, Scala, and Python that
allows the composition of queries from relational operators such as selection, filter, and join in
a very intuitive way. Flink’s SQL support is based on [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/)
which implements the SQL standard. Queries specified in either interface have the same semantics
and specify the same result regardless of whether the input is continuous (streaming) or bounded (batch).

The Table API and SQL interfaces integrate seamlessly with each other and Flink’s DataStream API.
You can easily switch between all APIs and libraries which build upon them.
For instance, you can detect patterns from a table using [`MATCH_RECOGNIZE` clause](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/dev/table/sql/queries/match_recognize/)
and later use the DataStream API to build alerting based on the matched patterns.

## Table Program Dependencies  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/dev/table/overview/\#table-program-dependencies)

You will need to add the Table API as a dependency to a project in order to use Table API & SQL for
defining data pipelines.

For more information on how to configure these dependencies for Java and Scala, please refer to the
[project configuration](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/dev/configuration/overview/) section.

If you are using Python, please refer to the documentation on the [Python API](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/dev/python/overview/)
