###### Support & IT teams

### Eliminate duplicate support tickets & clunky email lists

Halt the flood of support requests during an incident with proactive customer communication. Manage subscribers directly in Statuspage and send consistent messages through the channels of your choice (email, text message, in-app message, etc.)

###### DEVOPS & IT TEAMS

### Display the status of each part of your service

Control which components of your service you show on your page, and tap into 150+ third party components to display the status of mission-critical tools your service relies on like Stripe, Mailgun, Shopify, and PagerDuty.

## Statuspage is the communication piece of your incident management process

Keep users in the loop from ‘investigating’ through ‘resolved’.

Statuspage integrates with your favorite monitoring, alerting, chat, and help desk tools for efficient response every time.

###### INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAMS

### Level-up your incident communication

Take the hassle out of incident communication. Pre-written templates and tight integrations with the incident management tools you already rely on enable you to quickly get the word out to users.

###### MARKETING & SALES TEAMS

### Showcase reliability

Turn your page into a sales and marketing tool with Uptime Showcase, which lets you display historical uptime to current and prospective customers.

## Trusted by thousands of companies
