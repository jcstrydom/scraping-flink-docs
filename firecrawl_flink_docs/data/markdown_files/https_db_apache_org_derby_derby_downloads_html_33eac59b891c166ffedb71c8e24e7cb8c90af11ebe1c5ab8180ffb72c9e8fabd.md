## Derby Retired

**On 2025-10-10, the Derby developers voted to retire the project into a read-only state. Derby development and bug-fixing have ended. No further releases will be published. The Derby website and associated wiki are frozen in place. Derby JIRA issues are now read-only and new bugs cannot be logged. The user and developer lists are disabled and can be accessed only through their archives.**

**Downloads are available on an as-is basis.**

## Deprecated Releases

Derby 10.5.2.0 was removed from the website because of a wrong results regression bug (DERBY-4331). Its replacement release, 10.5.3.0, includes the other fixes listed in the [10.5.2.0 release notes](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/db/derby/code/tags/10.5.2.0/RELEASE-NOTES.html?view=co).

The following releases were removed from the Derby website because they contained a serious, data-corrupting bug.
However, you may still want to review their release notes in order to reconstruct the complete history
of changes to Derby:

- [Release notes for 10.3.1.4](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/db/derby/code/tags/10.3.1.4/RELEASE-NOTES.html?view=co)
