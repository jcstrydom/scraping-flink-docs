The Apache® Hadoop® project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing.

The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

[Release 3.4.1 available](https://hadoop.apache.org/release/3.4.1.html) 2024 Oct 18

This is a release of Apache Hadoop 3.4.1 line.

Users of Apache Hadoop 3.4.0 and earlier should upgrade to
this release.

All users are encouraged to read the [overview of major changes](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.4.1/index.html)
since release 3.4.0.

We have also introduced a lean tar which is a small tar file that does not contain the AWS SDK
because the size of AWS SDK is itself 500 MB. This can ease usage for non AWS users.
Even AWS users can add this jar explicitly if desired.

Feature highlights:

## SBOM artifacts

Starting from this release, Hadoop publishes Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) using
CycloneDX Maven plugin. For more information on SBOM, please go to
[SBOM](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/SBOM).

## HDFS RBF: RDBMS based token storage support

HDFS Router-Router Based Federation now supports storing delegation tokens on MySQL,
[HADOOP-18535](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-18535)
which improves token operation through over the original Zookeeper-based implementation.

## New File System APIs

[HADOOP-18671](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-18671) moved a number of
HDFS-specific APIs to Hadoop Common to make it possible for certain applications that
depend on HDFS semantics to run on other Hadoop compatible file systems.

In particular, recoverLease() and isFileClosed() are exposed through LeaseRecoverable
interface, while setSafeMode() is exposed through SafeMode interface.

Users are encouraged to read the [overview of major changes](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.3.6/index.html) since release 3.3.5.
For details of 117 bug fixes, improvements, and other enhancements since the previous 3.3.5 release,
please check [release notes](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.3.6/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/release/3.3.6/RELEASENOTES.3.3.6.html) and [changelog](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.3.6/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/release/3.3.6/CHANGELOG.3.3.6.html).

[Release 3.3.5 available](https://hadoop.apache.org/release/3.3.5.html) 2023 Mar 22

This is a release of Apache Hadoop 3.3 line.

Key changes include

- A big update of dependencies to try and keep those reports of
transitive CVEs under control -both genuine and false positives.
- Critical fix to ABFS input stream prefetching for correct reading.
- Vectored IO API for all FSDataInputStream implementations, with
high-performance versions for file:// and s3a:// filesystems.
file:// through java native IO
s3a:// parallel GET requests.
- Arm64 binaries. Note, because the arm64 release was on a different
platform, the jar files may not match those of the x86
release -and therefore the maven artifacts.
- Security fixes in Hadoop’s own code.

Users of Apache Hadoop 3.3.4 and earlier should upgrade to
this release.

All users are encouraged to read the [overview of major changes](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.3.5/index.html)

## Azure ABFS: Critical Stream Prefetch Fix

The ABFS connector has a critical bug fix
[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-18546](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-18546):
_ABFS. Disable purging list of in-progress reads in abfs stream close()._

All users of the abfs connector in hadoop releases 3.3.2+ MUST either upgrade
to this release or disable prefetching by setting
`fs.azure.readaheadqueue.depth` to `0`.
