# Set up JobManager Memory  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup_jobmanager/\#set-up-jobmanager-memory)

The JobManager is the controlling element of the Flink Cluster.
It consists of three distinct components: Resource Manager, Dispatcher and one JobMaster per running Flink Job.
This guide walks you through high level and fine-grained memory configurations for the JobManager.

The further described memory configuration is applicable starting with the release version _1.11_. If you upgrade Flink
from earlier versions, check the [migration guide](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_migration/) because many changes were introduced with the _1.11_ release.

> This memory setup guide is relevant **only for the JobManager**!
> The JobManager memory components have a similar but simpler structure compared to the [TaskManagers’ memory configuration](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup_tm/).

## Configure Total Memory  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup_jobmanager/\#configure-total-memory)

The simplest way to set up the memory configuration is to configure the [total memory](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup/#configure-total-memory) for the process.
If you run the JobManager process using local [execution mode](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup_jobmanager/#local-execution) you do not need to configure memory options, they will have no effect.

## Detailed configuration  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup_jobmanager/\#detailed-configuration)

![Flink's process memory model](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/fig/process_mem_model.svg)

The following table lists all memory components, depicted above, and references Flink configuration options which
affect the size of the respective components:

| **Component** | **Configuration options** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [JVM Heap](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup_jobmanager/#configure-jvm-heap) | [`jobmanager.memory.heap.size`](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/config/#jobmanager-memory-heap-size) | _JVM Heap_ memory size for job manager. |
| [Off-heap Memory](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup_jobmanager/#configure-off-heap-memory) | [`jobmanager.memory.off-heap.size`](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/config/#jobmanager-memory-off-heap-size) | _Off-heap_ memory size for job manager. This option covers all off-heap memory usage including direct and native memory allocation. |
| [JVM metaspace](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup/#jvm-parameters) | [`jobmanager.memory.jvm-metaspace.size`](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/config/#jobmanager-memory-jvm-metaspace-size) | Metaspace size of the Flink JVM process |
| JVM Overhead | [`jobmanager.memory.jvm-overhead.min`](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/config/#jobmanager-memory-jvm-overhead-min)<br>[`jobmanager.memory.jvm-overhead.max`](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/config/#jobmanager-memory-jvm-overhead-max)<br>[`jobmanager.memory.jvm-overhead.fraction`](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/config/#jobmanager-memory-jvm-overhead-fraction) | Native memory reserved for other JVM overhead: e.g. thread stacks, code cache, garbage collection space etc, it is a [capped fractionated component](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup/#capped-fractionated-components) of the [total process memory](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup/#configure-total-memory) |

### Configure JVM Heap  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup_jobmanager/\#configure-jvm-heap)

As mentioned before in the [total memory description](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup/#configure-total-memory), another way to set up the memory
for the JobManager is to specify explicitly the _JVM Heap_ size ( [`jobmanager.memory.heap.size`](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/config/#jobmanager-memory-heap-size)).
It gives more control over the available _JVM Heap_ which is used by:

- Flink framework
- User code executed during job submission (e.g. for certain batch sources) or in checkpoint completion callbacks

The required size of _JVM Heap_ is mostly driven by the number of running jobs, their structure, and requirements for
the mentioned user code.

Note If you have configured the _JVM Heap_ explicitly, it is recommended to set
neither _total process memory_ nor _total Flink memory_. Otherwise, it may easily lead to memory configuration conflicts.

The Flink scripts and CLI set the _JVM Heap_ size via the JVM parameters _-Xms_ and _-Xmx_ when they start the JobManager process, see also [JVM parameters](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup/#jvm-parameters).

### Configure Off-heap Memory  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup_jobmanager/\#configure-off-heap-memory)

The _Off-heap_ memory component accounts for any type of _JVM direct memory_ and _native memory_ usage. Therefore,
you can also enable the _JVM Direct Memory_ limit by setting the [`jobmanager.memory.enable-jvm-direct-memory-limit`](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/config/#jobmanager-memory-enable-jvm-direct-memory-limit) option.
If this option is configured, Flink will set the limit to the _Off-heap_ memory size via the corresponding JVM argument: _-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize_.
See also [JVM parameters](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup/#jvm-parameters).

The size of this component can be configured by [`jobmanager.memory.off-heap.size`](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/config/#jobmanager-memory-off-heap-size)
option. This option can be tuned e.g. if the JobManager process throws ‘OutOfMemoryError: Direct buffer memory’, see
[the troubleshooting guide](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_trouble/#outofmemoryerror-direct-buffer-memory) for more information.

There can be the following possible sources of _Off-heap_ memory consumption:

- Flink framework dependencies (e.g. Pekko network communication)
- User code executed during job submission (e.g. for certain batch sources) or in checkpoint completion callbacks

Note If you have configured the [Total Flink Memory](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup/#configure-total-memory)
and the [JVM Heap](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup_jobmanager/#configure-jvm-heap) explicitly but you have not configured the _Off-heap_ memory, the size of the _Off-heap_ memory
will be derived as the [Total Flink Memory](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup/#configure-total-memory) minus the [JVM Heap](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup_jobmanager/#configure-jvm-heap).
The default value of the _Off-heap_ memory option will be ignored.

## Local Execution  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/memory/mem_setup_jobmanager/\#local-execution)

If you run Flink locally (e.g. from your IDE) without creating a cluster, then the JobManager memory configuration options are ignored.
