# Raw Format  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/connectors/table/formats/raw/\#raw-format)

Format: Serialization SchemaFormat: Deserialization Schema

The Raw format allows to read and write raw (byte based) values as a single column.

Note: this format encodes `null` values as `null` of `byte[]` type. This may have limitation when used in `upsert-kafka`, because `upsert-kafka` treats `null` values as a tombstone message (DELETE on the key). Therefore, we recommend avoiding using `upsert-kafka` connector and the `raw` format as a `value.format` if the field can have a `null` value.

The Raw connector is built-in, no additional dependencies are required.

## Example  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/connectors/table/formats/raw/\#example)

For example, you may have following raw log data in Kafka and want to read and analyse such data using Flink SQL.

```
47.29.201.179 - - [28/Feb/2019:13:17:10 +0000] "GET /?p=1 HTTP/2.0" 200 5316 "https://domain.com/?p=1" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/72.0.3626.119 Safari/537.36" "2.75"
```

The following creates a table where it reads from (and can writes to) the underlying Kafka topic as an anonymous string value in UTF-8 encoding by using `raw` format:

```sql
CREATE TABLE nginx_log (
  log STRING
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'kafka',
  'topic' = 'nginx_log',
  'properties.bootstrap.servers' = 'localhost:9092',
  'properties.group.id' = 'testGroup',
  'format' = 'raw'
)
```

Then you can read out the raw data as a pure string, and split it into multiple fields using an user-defined-function for further analysing, e.g. `my_split` in the example.

```sql
SELECT t.hostname, t.datetime, t.url, t.browser, ...
FROM(
  SELECT my_split(log) as t FROM nginx_log
);
```

In contrast, you can also write a single column of STRING type into this Kafka topic as an anonymous string value in UTF-8 encoding.

## Format Options  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/connectors/table/formats/raw/\#format-options)

| Option | Required | Default | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ##### format [Anchor link for: format](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/connectors/table/formats/raw/\#format) | required | (none) | String | Specify what format to use, here should be 'raw'. |
| ##### raw.charset [Anchor link for: raw charset](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/connectors/table/formats/raw/\#raw-charset) | optional | UTF-8 | String | Specify the charset to encode the text string. |
| ##### raw.endianness [Anchor link for: raw endianness](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/connectors/table/formats/raw/\#raw-endianness) | optional | big-endian | String | Specify the endianness to encode the bytes of numeric value. Valid values are 'big-endian' and 'little-endian'.<br> See more details of [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness). |

## Data Type Mapping  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/connectors/table/formats/raw/\#data-type-mapping)

The table below details the SQL types the format supports, including details of the serializer and deserializer class for encoding and decoding.

| Flink SQL type | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CHAR / VARCHAR / STRING` | A UTF-8 (by default) encoded text string.<br> The encoding charset can be configured by 'raw.charset'. |
| `BINARY / VARBINARY / BYTES` | The sequence of bytes itself. |
| `BOOLEAN` | A single byte to indicate boolean value, 0 means false, 1 means true. |
| `TINYINT` | A single byte of the signed number value. |
| `SMALLINT` | Two bytes with big-endian (by default) encoding.<br> The endianness can be configured by 'raw.endianness'. |
| `INT` | Four bytes with big-endian (by default) encoding.<br> The endianness can be configured by 'raw.endianness'. |
| `BIGINT` | Eight bytes with big-endian (by default) encoding.<br> The endianness can be configured by 'raw.endianness'. |
| `FLOAT` | Four bytes with IEEE 754 format and big-endian (by default) encoding.<br> The endianness can be configured by 'raw.endianness'. |
| `DOUBLE` | Eight bytes with IEEE 754 format and big-endian (by default) encoding.<br> The endianness can be configured by 'raw.endianness'. |
| `RAW` | The sequence of bytes serialized by the underlying TypeSerializer of the RAW type. |
