# Fault Tolerance Guarantees of Data Sources and Sinks  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/connectors/datastream/guarantees/\#fault-tolerance-guarantees-of-data-sources-and-sinks)

Flink’s fault tolerance mechanism recovers programs in the presence of failures and
continues to execute them. Such failures include machine hardware failures, network failures,
transient program failures, etc.

Flink can guarantee exactly-once state updates to user-defined state only when the source participates in the
snapshotting mechanism. The following table lists the state update guarantees of Flink coupled with the bundled connectors.

Please read the documentation of each connector to understand the details of the fault tolerance guarantees.

| Source | Guarantees | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apache Kafka | exactly once | Use the appropriate Kafka connector for your version |
| AWS Kinesis Streams | exactly once |  |
| RabbitMQ | at most once (v 0.10) / exactly once (v 1.0) |  |
| Google PubSub | at least once |  |
| Collections | exactly once |  |
| Files | exactly once |  |
| Sockets | at most once |  |

To guarantee end-to-end exactly-once record delivery (in addition to exactly-once state semantics), the data sink needs
to take part in the checkpointing mechanism. The following table lists the delivery guarantees (assuming exactly-once
state updates) of Flink coupled with bundled sinks:

| Sink | Guarantees | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Elasticsearch | at least once |  |
| Opensearch | at least once |  |
| Kafka producer | at least once / exactly once | exactly once with transactional producers (v 0.11+) |
| Cassandra sink | at least once / exactly once | exactly once only for idempotent updates |
| Amazon DynamoDB | at least once |  |
| Amazon Kinesis Data Streams | at least once |  |
| Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose | at least once |  |
| File sinks | exactly once |  |
| Socket sinks | at least once |  |
| Standard output | at least once |  |
| Redis sink | at least once |  |
