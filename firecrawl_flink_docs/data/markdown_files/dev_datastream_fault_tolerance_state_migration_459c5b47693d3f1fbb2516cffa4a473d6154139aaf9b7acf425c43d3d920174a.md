# State TTL Migration Compatibility  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/state_migration/\#state-ttl-migration-compatibility)

Starting with **Apache Flink 2.2.0**, the system supports seamless enabling or disabling of **State Time-to-Live (TTL)** for existing state.
This enhancement removes prior limitations where a change in TTL configuration could cause a `StateMigrationException` during restore.

## Version Overview  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/state_migration/\#version-overview)

| Flink Version | Change |
| --- | --- |
| **2.0.0** | Introduced `TtlAwareSerializer` to support TTL/non-TTL serializer compatibility |
| **2.1.0** | Added TTL migration support for **RocksDBKeyedStateBackend** |
| **2.2.0** | Added TTL migration support for **HeapKeyedStateBackend** |

> Full TTL state migration support across all major state backends is available from Flink **2.2.0** onwards.

## Motivation  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/state_migration/\#motivation)

In earlier Flink versions, switching TTL on or off in a `StateDescriptor` resulted in incompatibility errors.
This was because TTL-enabled state used a different serialization format than non-TTL state.

## Compatibility Behavior  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/state_migration/\#compatibility-behavior)

With the changes introduced across versions 2.0.0 to 2.2.0:

- Flink can now restore state created **without TTL** using a descriptor **with TTL enabled**.
- Flink can also restore state created **with TTL** using a descriptor **without TTL enabled**.

The serializers and state backends transparently handle the presence or absence of TTL metadata.

## Supported Migration Scenarios  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/state_migration/\#supported-migration-scenarios)

| Migration Type | Available Since | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-TTL state → TTL-enabled descriptor | 2.1.0 (RocksDB), 2.2.0 (Heap) | Previous state restored as non-expired. TTL applied on new updates/accesses. |
| TTL state → Non-TTL descriptor | 2.1.0 (RocksDB), 2.2.0 (Heap) | TTL metadata is ignored. State becomes permanently visible. |

## Limitations  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/state_migration/\#limitations)

- Changes to TTL **parameters** (e.g. expiration time, update behavior) are not always compatible. These may require serializer migration.
- TTL is not applied retroactively. Existing entries restored from non-TTL state will only expire after their next access or update.
- This compatibility assumes no other incompatible changes to the state serializer.

## Example  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/state_migration/\#example)

```java
ValueStateDescriptor<String> descriptor = new ValueStateDescriptor<>("user-state", String.class);
descriptor.enableTimeToLive(StateTtlConfig.newBuilder(Time.hours(1)).build());
```

If this descriptor replaces an earlier one without TTL, the state will be restored successfully in Flink 2.2.0+ and TTL will be enforced going forward.

## FAQ  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/state_migration/\#faq)

### Can I disable TTL after it was previously enabled?  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/state_migration/\#can-i-disable-ttl-after-it-was-previously-enabled)

Yes. Flink will restore the values and ignore any TTL expiration metadata.

### Is this supported in RocksDB and Heap backends?  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/state_migration/\#is-this-supported-in-rocksdb-and-heap-backends)

Yes, RocksDB since 2.1.0, Heap since 2.2.0 but ForSt is not yet added.

### Which Flink version fully supports TTL migration?  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/state_migration/\#which-flink-version-fully-supports-ttl-migration)

Flink 2.2.0 is the first version where all necessary support is available.

### Do I need to change anything in my savepoint?  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/state_migration/\#do-i-need-to-change-anything-in-my-savepoint)

No. The migration is handled internally by Flink, provided serializers are otherwise compatible.
