The Apache Software Foundation uses various licenses to distribute
software and documentation, and to accept regular
contributions from individuals and corporations and larger grants of existing software products.

These licenses help us achieve our goal of providing reliable and
long-lived software products through collaborative, open-source software
development. In all cases, contributors retain full rights to use their
original contributions for any other purpose outside of Apache while
providing the ASF and its projects the right to distribute and build upon
their work within Apache.
