# Request a Confluence account

Confluence is a popular wiki. As with a lot of things these days, wikis are a popular target for spammers. It is with regret that we currently are not accepting new accounts unless
vetted by an ASF Project beforehand.

If you are a committer to an ASF project, use your ASF id and password to login to Confluence. If not, use this form to request an account, after which the project will then grant
you edit access if appropriate.

##### Please read the following before you request a Confluence account:

- You do NOT need a Confluence account to view wiki pages.
- Have you discussed requiring wiki access on the appropriate mailing list?
Depending on the topic, wiki access may not be needed.

Select the ASF project you will initially be contributing to with this account. Make sure you have selected the correct project, and that they are using Confluence as a wiki, as the project will be reviewing your account request. Once your account is approved, you can use that same account for other project wikis that grant you write
access.

Email address

We'll never share your email with anyone else. Please ensure this email address is correct, as we will use it to verify your request.

Desired user name

Your user name must be between 4 and 20 characters long, alphanumeric only.

Your real (public) name

This is your actual name, as it will appear on Confluence pages you edit.

Tell us a little about what you intend to use this account for.


N.B. You do NOT need an account to view Confluence pages.


Adding a proper description of your intended use for this account will assist the project in reviewing this request.

I agree to let the project for which I am requesting an account review my public data.

We will share your user name, public name, and reason for requesting an account with the project you specify, but will _not_ share your email address.
