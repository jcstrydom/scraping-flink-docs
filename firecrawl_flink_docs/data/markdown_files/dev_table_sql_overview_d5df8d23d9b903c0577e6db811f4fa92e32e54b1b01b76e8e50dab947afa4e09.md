# SQL  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/overview/\#sql)

This page describes the SQL language supported in Flink, including Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Query Language. Flink’s SQL support is based on [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/) which implements the SQL standard.

This page lists all the supported statements supported in Flink SQL for now:

- [SELECT (Queries)](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/queries/overview/)
- [CREATE TABLE, CATALOG, DATABASE, VIEW, FUNCTION](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/create/)
- [DROP TABLE, DATABASE, VIEW, FUNCTION](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/drop/)
- [ALTER TABLE, DATABASE, FUNCTION](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/alter/)
- [ANALYZE TABLE](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/analyze/)
- [INSERT](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/insert/)
- [UPDATE](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/update/)
- [DELETE](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/delete/)
- [DESCRIBE](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/describe/)
- [EXPLAIN](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/explain/)
- [USE](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/use/)
- [SHOW](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/show/)
- [LOAD](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/load/)
- [UNLOAD](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/unload/)

## Data Types  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/overview/\#data-types)

Please see the dedicated page about [data types](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/types/).

Generic types and (nested) composite types (e.g., POJOs, tuples, rows, Scala case classes) can be fields of a row as well.

Fields of composite types with arbitrary nesting can be accessed with [value access functions](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/functions/systemfunctions/#value-access-functions).

Generic types are treated as a black box and can be passed on or processed by [user-defined functions](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/functions/udfs/).

For DDLs, we support full data types defined in page [Data Types](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/types/).

**Notes:** Some of the data types are not supported in SQL queries yet (i.e. in cast expressions or literals). E.g. `STRING`, `BYTES`, `RAW`, `TIME(p) WITHOUT TIME ZONE`, `TIME(p) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE`, `TIMESTAMP(p) WITHOUT TIME ZONE`, `TIMESTAMP(p) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE`, `ARRAY`, `MULTISET`, `ROW`.

## Reserved Keywords  [\#](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/dev/table/sql/overview/\#reserved-keywords)

Although not every SQL feature is implemented yet, some string combinations are already reserved as keywords for future use. If you want to use one of the following strings as a field name, make sure to surround them with backticks (e.g. ```value```, ```count```).
