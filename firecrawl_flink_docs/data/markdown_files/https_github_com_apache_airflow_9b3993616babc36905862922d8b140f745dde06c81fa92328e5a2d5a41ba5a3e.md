We are using the docker image caching mechanism here. The random file will be regenerated only when the previous layer (which is about installling Airflow dependencies for the first time) gets rebuild. And for us this is the indication, that the building the image will take quite some time. This layer should be relatively static - even if setup.py changes the CI image is designed in the way that the first time installation of Airflow dependencies is not invalidated.

With this PR, we should be able to iterate over task-sdk-integration-tests WAY faster and get more contributors involved in contributing to those.  * It was not clear that prerequisite of running the tests was building   PROD image for Pyton 3.10. This is now clear in the documentation.  * PROD images can be built in two different modes - from sources   with --installation-method equal to . or from packages with   the --installatio-method equal to \"apache-airflow\". This was   not clearly communicated during build and it is now printed at   output  * It was not clear that when you build PROD images from sources,   you should first compile ui assets, because otehrwise the   assets are not added as part of the image. With this PR the   `breeze prod-image build` command checks if the .vite manifest   is present in the right `dist` folders and will error out,   suggesting to run `breeze compile-ui-assets` before.  * If the PROD image has not been built before, breeze will propose   to build it and even do it automatically if the answer is not   provided within 20 seconds.  * when building PROD images from sources, it is faster to rebuild   the images with `uv` than with `pip`. the --use-uv parameter now   defaults to False when building from packages and to True when   building from sources.  * There was an error in .dockerignore where generated dist files   were not added to context when PROD image was built from sources.   This resulted in \"permission denied' when such PROD images were used   to run tests.  * The test compose had fallback of Airflow 3.0.3 which would be   misleading if it happened. Now, AIRFLOW_IMAGE_NAME is mandatory  * We are now mounting sources of Airflow to inside the image by default   and skip it in CI. This mounting happens in local environment where PROD   image is built usually from sources, and it is disabled in CI by using   --skip-mounting-local-volumes flag. We also do not stop docker compose   by default when runnig it locally in order to make fast iteration the   default.  * We pass host operating system when starting the compose, and we only   change ownership on Linux - this is a long running operation on MacOS   because mounted filesystem is slow, but it's also not needed on MacOS   because the file system also maps ownershipt and files created by   Airflow are created with local user id.  * We pass local user id to containers to make sure that the files   created on linux are created by the local user (logs and the like).  * We are now detecting whether docker-compose is running and when we run   with locally mounted sources, we reuse those running containers. When   we don't mount local sources, we shut-down the compose before running   to make sure we do not have sources mounted - and we close the compose   by default when we do not mount local sources.  * When sources are mounted we are only enabling DEV_MODE inside the containers   so that components are hot-reloading (new feature added in #57741   last weeks. This way you do not have to restart anything when sources   are changed and you can re-run the tests when docker compose is running.  * The environment are passsed now via .env file so that you can easily   reproduce docke compose command locally  * The docker compose files are not copied any more, they are moved directly   to the top of 'task-sdk-integraiton-tests' and used from there.  * A `--down` flag is added to breeze testing task-sdk-integration-tests   that tears down running docker compose.  * Additional diagnostics added to show what's going on.  * Handling verbose option from breeze by adding more debugging information  * Updated documentation about the tests to be more comprehensive about   the options, updated file structure etc.  * Small QOL immprovement - if expected dags are not yet parsed by dag file   processor, when test starts, getting their status will return 404 \"Not   Found\". In such case our tests implemented a short retry scheme with tenacity") [#…](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/58231) | 2 months agoNov 13, 2025 |

[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/) (or simply Airflow) is a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.

When workflows are defined as code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.

Use Airflow to author workflows (Dags) that orchestrate tasks. The Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on Dags a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.

## Project Focus

[Permalink: Project Focus](https://github.com/apache/airflow#project-focus)

Airflow works best with workflows that are mostly static and slowly changing. When the Dag structure is similar from one run to the next, it clarifies the unit of work and continuity. Other similar projects include [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi), [Oozie](https://oozie.apache.org/) and [Azkaban](https://azkaban.github.io/).

Airflow is commonly used to process data, but has the opinion that tasks should ideally be idempotent (i.e., results of the task will be the same, and will not create duplicated data in a destination system), and should not pass large quantities of data from one task to the next (though tasks can pass metadata using Airflow's [XCom feature](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/xcoms.html)). For high-volume, data-intensive tasks, a best practice is to delegate to external services specializing in that type of work.

Airflow is not a streaming solution, but it is often used to process real-time data, pulling data off streams in batches.

## Principles

[Permalink: Principles](https://github.com/apache/airflow#principles)

- **Dynamic**: Pipelines are defined in code, enabling dynamic dag generation and parameterization.
- **Extensible**: The Airflow framework includes a wide range of built-in operators and can be extended to fit your needs.
- **Flexible**: Airflow leverages the [**Jinja**](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templating engine, allowing rich customizations.

## Requirements

[Permalink: Requirements](https://github.com/apache/airflow#requirements)

Apache Airflow is tested with:

|  | Main version (dev) | Stable version (3.1.6) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 |
| Platform | AMD64/ARM64(\*) | AMD64/ARM64(\*) |
| Kubernetes | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33, 1.34, 1.35 | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33 |
| PostgreSQL | 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 |
| MySQL | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation |
| SQLite | 3.15.0+ | 3.15.0+ |

\\* Experimental

**Note**: MariaDB is not tested/recommended.

**Note**: SQLite is used in Airflow tests. Do not use it in production. We recommend
using the latest stable version of SQLite for local development.

**Note**: Airflow currently can be run on POSIX-compliant Operating Systems. For development, it is regularly
tested on fairly modern Linux Distros and recent versions of macOS.
On Windows you can run it via WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) or via Linux Containers.
The work to add Windows support is tracked via [#10388](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10388), but
it is not a high priority. You should only use Linux-based distros as "Production" execution environment
as this is the only environment that is supported. The only distro that is used in our CI tests and that
is used in the [Community managed DockerHub image](https://hub.docker.com/p/apache/airflow) is
`Debian Bookworm`.

## Installing from PyPI

[Permalink: Installing from PyPI](https://github.com/apache/airflow#installing-from-pypi)

We publish Apache Airflow as `apache-airflow` package in PyPI. Installing it however might be sometimes tricky
because Airflow is a bit of both a library and application. Libraries usually keep their dependencies open, and
applications usually pin them, but we should do neither and both simultaneously. We decided to keep
our dependencies as open as possible (in `pyproject.toml`) so users can install different versions of libraries
if needed. This means that `pip install apache-airflow` will not work from time to time or will
produce unusable Airflow installation.

To have repeatable installation, however, we keep a set of "known-to-be-working" constraint
files in the orphan `constraints-main` and `constraints-2-0` branches. We keep those "known-to-be-working"
constraints files separately per major/minor Python version.
You can use them as constraint files when installing Airflow from PyPI. Note that you have to specify
correct Airflow tag/version/branch and Python versions in the URL.

1. Installing just Airflow:

> Note: Only `pip` installation is currently officially supported.

While it is possible to install Airflow with tools like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or
[pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools), they do not share the same workflow as
`pip` \- especially when it comes to constraint vs. requirements management.
Installing via `Poetry` or `pip-tools` is not currently supported.

If you wish to install Airflow using those tools, you should use the constraint files and convert
them to the appropriate format and workflow that your tool requires.

```
pip install 'apache-airflow==3.1.6' \
 --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.1.6/constraints-3.10.txt"
```

2. Installing with extras (i.e., postgres, google)

```
pip install 'apache-airflow[postgres,google]==3.1.6' \
 --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.1.6/constraints-3.10.txt"
```

For information on installing provider distributions, check
[providers](http://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/index.html).

## Installation

For comprehensive instructions on setting up your local development environment and installing Apache Airflow, please refer to the [INSTALLING.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/INSTALLING.md) file.

## Official source code

[Permalink: Official source code](https://github.com/apache/airflow#official-source-code)

Apache Airflow is an [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/) (ASF) project,
and our official source code releases:

- Follow the [ASF Release Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html)
- Can be downloaded from [the ASF Distribution Directory](https://downloads.apache.org/airflow)
- Are cryptographically signed by the release manager
- Are officially voted on by the PMC members during the
[Release Approval Process](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#release-approval)

Following the ASF rules, the source packages released must be sufficient for a user to build and test the
release provided they have access to the appropriate platform and tools.

## Convenience packages

[Permalink: Convenience packages](https://github.com/apache/airflow#convenience-packages)

There are other ways of installing and using Airflow. Those are "convenience" methods - they are
not "official releases" as stated by the `ASF Release Policy`, but they can be used by the users
who do not want to build the software themselves.

Those are - in the order of most common ways people install Airflow:

- [PyPI releases](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow/) to install Airflow using standard `pip` tool
- [Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow) to install airflow via
`docker` tool, use them in Kubernetes, Helm Charts, `docker-compose`, `docker swarm`, etc. You can
read more about using, customizing, and extending the images in the
[Latest docs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/index.html), and
learn details on the internals in the [images](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/index.html) document.
- [Tags in GitHub](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tags) to retrieve the git project sources that
were used to generate official source packages via git

All those artifacts are not official releases, but they are prepared using officially released sources.
Some of those artifacts are "development" or "pre-release" ones, and they are clearly marked as such
following the ASF Policy.

## Semantic versioning

[Permalink: Semantic versioning](https://github.com/apache/airflow#semantic-versioning)

As of Airflow 2.0.0, we support a strict [SemVer](https://semver.org/) approach for all packages released.

There are few specific rules that we agreed to that define details of versioning of the different
packages:

- **Airflow**: SemVer rules apply to core airflow only (excludes any changes to providers).
Changing limits for versions of Airflow dependencies is not a breaking change on its own.
- **Airflow Providers**: SemVer rules apply to changes in the particular provider's code only.
SemVer MAJOR and MINOR versions for the packages are independent of the Airflow version.
For example, `google 4.1.0` and `amazon 3.1.1` providers can happily be installed
with `Airflow 2.1.2`. If there are limits of cross-dependencies between providers and Airflow packages,
they are present in providers as `install_requires` limitations. We aim to keep backwards
compatibility of providers with all previously released Airflow 2 versions but
there will sometimes be breaking changes that might make some, or all
providers, have minimum Airflow version specified.
- **Airflow Helm Chart**: SemVer rules apply to changes in the chart only. SemVer MAJOR and MINOR
versions for the chart are independent of the Airflow version. We aim to keep backwards
compatibility of the Helm Chart with all released Airflow 2 versions, but some new features might
only work starting from specific Airflow releases. We might however limit the Helm
Chart to depend on minimal Airflow version.
- **Airflow API clients**: Their versioning is independent from Airflow versions. They follow their own
SemVer rules for breaking changes and new features - which for example allows to change the way we generate
the clients.

## Version Life Cycle

[Permalink: Version Life Cycle](https://github.com/apache/airflow#version-life-cycle)

Apache Airflow version life cycle:

| Version | Current Patch/Minor | State | First Release | Limited Maintenance | EOL/Terminated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 3.1.6 | Supported | Apr 22, 2025 | TBD | TBD |
| 2 | 2.11.0 | Supported | Dec 17, 2020 | Oct 22, 2025 | Apr 22, 2026 |
| 1.10 | 1.10.15 | EOL | Aug 27, 2018 | Dec 17, 2020 | June 17, 2021 |
| 1.9 | 1.9.0 | EOL | Jan 03, 2018 | Aug 27, 2018 | Aug 27, 2018 |
| 1.8 | 1.8.2 | EOL | Mar 19, 2017 | Jan 03, 2018 | Jan 03, 2018 |
| 1.7 | 1.7.1.2 | EOL | Mar 28, 2016 | Mar 19, 2017 | Mar 19, 2017 |

Limited support versions will be supported with security and critical bug fix only.
EOL versions will not get any fixes nor support.
We always recommend that all users run the latest available minor release for whatever major version is in use.
We **highly** recommend upgrading to the latest Airflow major release at the earliest convenient time and before the EOL date.

## Support for Python and Kubernetes versions

[Permalink: Support for Python and Kubernetes versions](https://github.com/apache/airflow#support-for-python-and-kubernetes-versions)

As of Airflow 2.0, we agreed to certain rules we follow for Python and Kubernetes support.
They are based on the official release schedule of Python and Kubernetes, nicely summarized in the
[Python Developer's Guide](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches) and
[Kubernetes version skew policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/).

1. We drop support for Python and Kubernetes versions when they reach EOL. Except for Kubernetes, a
version stays supported by Airflow if two major cloud providers still provide support for it. We drop
support for those EOL versions in main right after EOL date, and it is effectively removed when we release
the first new MINOR (Or MAJOR if there is no new MINOR version) of Airflow. For example, for Python 3.10 it
means that we will drop support in main right after 27.06.2023, and the first MAJOR or MINOR version of
Airflow released after will not have it.

2. We support a new version of Python/Kubernetes in main after they are officially released, as soon as we
make them work in our CI pipeline (which might not be immediate due to dependencies catching up with
new versions of Python mostly) we release new images/support in Airflow based on the working CI setup.

3. This policy is best-effort which means there may be situations where we might terminate support earlier
if circumstances require it.


## Base OS support for reference Airflow images

[Permalink: Base OS support for reference Airflow images](https://github.com/apache/airflow#base-os-support-for-reference-airflow-images)

The Airflow Community provides conveniently packaged container images that are published whenever
we publish an Apache Airflow release. Those images contain:

- Base OS with necessary packages to install Airflow (stable Debian OS)
- Base Python installation in versions supported at the time of release for the MINOR version of
Airflow released (so there could be different versions for 2.3 and 2.2 line for example)
- Libraries required to connect to supported Databases (again the set of databases supported depends
on the MINOR version of Airflow)
- Predefined set of popular providers (for details see the [Dockerfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/Dockerfile)).
- Possibility of building your own, custom image where the user can choose their own set of providers
and libraries (see [Building the image](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/build.html))
- In the future Airflow might also support a "slim" version without providers nor database clients installed

The version of the base OS image is the stable version of Debian. Airflow supports using all currently active
stable versions - as soon as all Airflow dependencies support building, and we set up the CI pipeline for
building and testing the OS version. Approximately 6 months before the end-of-regular support of a
previous stable version of the OS, Airflow switches the images released to use the latest supported
version of the OS.

For example switch from `Debian Bullseye` to `Debian Bookworm` has been implemented
before 2.8.0 release in October 2023 and `Debian Bookworm` will be the only option supported as of
Airflow 2.10.0.

Users will continue to be able to build their images using stable Debian releases until the end of regular
support and building and verifying of the images happens in our CI but no unit tests were executed using
this image in the `main` branch.

## Approach to dependencies of Airflow

[Permalink: Approach to dependencies of Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow#approach-to-dependencies-of-airflow)

Airflow has a lot of dependencies - direct and transitive, also Airflow is both - library and application,
therefore our policies to dependencies has to include both - stability of installation of application,
but also ability to install newer version of dependencies for those users who develop Dags. We developed
the approach where `constraints` are used to make sure airflow can be installed in a repeatable way, while
we do not limit our users to upgrade most of the dependencies. As a result we decided not to upper-bound
version of Airflow dependencies by default, unless we have good reasons to believe upper-bounding them is
needed because of importance of the dependency as well as risk it involves to upgrade specific dependency.
We also upper-bound the dependencies that we know cause problems.

The constraint mechanism of ours takes care about finding and upgrading all the non-upper bound dependencies
automatically (providing that all the tests pass). Our `main` build failures will indicate in case there
are versions of dependencies that break our tests - indicating that we should either upper-bind them or
that we should fix our code/tests to account for the upstream changes from those dependencies.

Whenever we upper-bound such a dependency, we should always comment why we are doing it - i.e. we should have
a good reason why dependency is upper-bound. And we should also mention what is the condition to remove the
binding.

### Approach for dependencies for Airflow Core

[Permalink: Approach for dependencies for Airflow Core](https://github.com/apache/airflow#approach-for-dependencies-for-airflow-core)

Those dependencies are maintained in `pyproject.toml`.

There are few dependencies that we decided are important enough to upper-bound them by default, as they are
known to follow predictable versioning scheme, and we know that new versions of those are very likely to
bring breaking changes. We commit to regularly review and attempt to upgrade to the newer versions of
the dependencies as they are released, but this is manual process.

The important dependencies are:

- `SQLAlchemy`: upper-bound to specific MINOR version (SQLAlchemy is known to remove deprecations and
introduce breaking changes especially that support for different Databases varies and changes at
various speed)
- `Alembic`: it is important to handle our migrations in predictable and performant way. It is developed
together with SQLAlchemy. Our experience with Alembic is that it very stable in MINOR version
- `Flask`: We are using Flask as the back-bone of our web UI and API. We know major version of Flask
are very likely to introduce breaking changes across those so limiting it to MAJOR version makes sense
- `werkzeug`: the library is known to cause problems in new versions. It is tightly coupled with Flask
libraries, and we should update them together
- `celery`: Celery is a crucial component of Airflow as it used for CeleryExecutor (and similar). Celery
[follows SemVer](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/contributing.html?highlight=semver#versions), so
we should upper-bound it to the next MAJOR version. Also, when we bump the upper version of the library,
we should make sure Celery Provider minimum Airflow version is updated.
- `kubernetes`: Kubernetes is a crucial component of Airflow as it is used for the KubernetesExecutor
(and similar). Kubernetes Python library [follows SemVer](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python#compatibility),
so we should upper-bound it to the next MAJOR version. Also, when we bump the upper version of the library,
we should make sure Kubernetes Provider minimum Airflow version is updated.

### Approach for dependencies in Airflow Providers and extras

[Permalink: Approach for dependencies in Airflow Providers and extras](https://github.com/apache/airflow#approach-for-dependencies-in-airflow-providers-and-extras)

The main part of the Airflow is the Airflow Core, but the power of Airflow also comes from a number of
providers that extend the core functionality and are released separately, even if we keep them (for now)
in the same monorepo for convenience. You can read more about the providers in the
[Providers documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/index.html). We also
have set of policies implemented for maintaining and releasing community-managed providers as well
as the approach for community vs. 3rd party providers in the [providers](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/PROVIDERS.rst) document.

Those `extras` and `providers` dependencies are maintained in `provider.yaml` of each provider.

By default, we should not upper-bound dependencies for providers, however each provider's maintainer
might decide to add additional limits (and justify them with comment).

## What goes into the next release?

[Permalink: What goes into the next release?](https://github.com/apache/airflow#what-goes-into-the-next-release)

Often you will see an issue that is assigned to specific milestone with Airflow version, or a PR that gets merged
to the main branch and you might wonder which release the merged PR(s) will be released in or which release the fixed
issues will be in. The answer to this is as usual - it depends on various scenarios. The answer is different for PRs and Issues.

To add a bit of context, we are following the [Semver](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme as described in
[Airflow release process](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/release-process.html). More
details are explained in detail in this README under the [Semantic versioning](https://github.com/apache/airflow#semantic-versioning) chapter, but
in short, we have `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versions of Airflow.

- `MAJOR` version is incremented in case of breaking changes
- `MINOR` version is incremented when there are new features added
- `PATCH` version is incremented when there are only bug-fixes and doc-only changes

Generally we release `MINOR` versions of Airflow from a branch that is named after the MINOR version. For example
`2.7.*` releases are released from `v2-7-stable` branch, `2.8.*` releases are released from `v2-8-stable`
branch, etc.

1. Most of the time in our release cycle, when the branch for next `MINOR` branch is not yet created, all
PRs merged to `main` (unless they get reverted), will find their way to the next `MINOR` release. For example
if the last release is `2.7.3` and `v2-8-stable` branch is not created yet, the next `MINOR` release
is `2.8.0` and all PRs merged to main will be released in `2.8.0`. However, some PRs (bug-fixes and
doc-only changes) when merged, can be cherry-picked to current `MINOR` branch and released in the
next `PATCHLEVEL` release. For example, if `2.8.1` is already released and we are working on `2.9.0dev`, then
marking a PR with `2.8.2` milestone means that it will be cherry-picked to `v2-8-test` branch and
released in `2.8.2rc1`, and eventually in `2.8.2`.

2. When we prepare for the next `MINOR` release, we cut new `v2-*-test` and `v2-*-stable` branch
and prepare `alpha`, `beta` releases for the next `MINOR` version, the PRs merged to main will still be
released in the next `MINOR` release until `rc` version is cut. This is happening because the `v2-*-test`
and `v2-*-stable` branches are rebased on top of main when next `beta` and `rc` releases are prepared.
For example, when we cut `2.10.0beta1` version, anything merged to main before `2.10.0rc1` is released,
will find its way to 2.10.0rc1.

3. Then, once we prepare the first RC candidate for the MINOR release, we stop moving the `v2-*-test` and
`v2-*-stable` branches and the PRs merged to main will be released in the next `MINOR` release.
However, some PRs (bug-fixes and doc-only changes) when merged, can be cherry-picked to current `MINOR`
branch and released in the next `PATCHLEVEL` release - for example when the last released version from `v2-10-stable`
branch is `2.10.0rc1`, some of the PRs from main can be marked as `2.10.0` milestone by committers,
the release manager will try to cherry-pick them into the release branch.
If successful, they will be released in `2.10.0rc2` and subsequently in `2.10.0`. This also applies to
subsequent `PATCHLEVEL` versions. When for example `2.10.1` is already released, marking a PR with
`2.10.2` milestone will mean that it will be cherry-picked to `v2-10-stable` branch and released in `2.10.2rc1`
and eventually in `2.10.2`.


The final decision about cherry-picking is made by the release manager.

Marking issues with a milestone is a bit different. Maintainers do not mark issues with a milestone usually,
normally they are only marked in PRs. If PR linked to the issue (and "fixing it") gets merged and released
in a specific version following the process described above, the issue will be automatically closed, no
milestone will be set for the issue, you need to check the PR that fixed the issue to see which version
it was released in.

However, sometimes maintainers mark issues with specific milestone, which means that the
issue is important to become a candidate to take a look when the release is being prepared. Since this is an
Open-Source project, where basically all contributors volunteer their time, there is no guarantee that specific
issue will be fixed in specific version. We do not want to hold the release because some issue is not fixed,
so in such case release manager will reassign such unfixed issues to the next milestone in case they are not
fixed in time for the current release. Therefore, the milestone for issue is more of an intent that it should be
looked at, than promise it will be fixed in the version.

More context and **FAQ** about the patchlevel release can be found in the
[What goes into the next release](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/WHAT_GOES_INTO_THE_NEXT_RELEASE.md) document in the `dev` folder of the
repository.
