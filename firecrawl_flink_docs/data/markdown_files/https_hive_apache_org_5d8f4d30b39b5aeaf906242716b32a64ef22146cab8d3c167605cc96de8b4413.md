## What is Apache Hive?

Apache Hive is a distributed, fault-tolerant data warehouse system that enables analytics at a massive scale.

##### Central Metadata Repository

Hive Metastore (HMS) provides a central repository of metadata that can easily be analyzed to make informed, data driven decisions, making it a critical component of many data lake architectures.

##### SQL Analytics at Scale

Built on top of Apache Hadoop with support for S3, ADLS, GS and more. Hive allows users to read, write, and manage petabytes of data using familiar SQL syntax.
