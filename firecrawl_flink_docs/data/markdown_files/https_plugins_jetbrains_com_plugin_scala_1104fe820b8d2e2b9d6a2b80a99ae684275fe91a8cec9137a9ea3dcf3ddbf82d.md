Still, the best IDE for scala. Compared with metals, I think it's more robust and more syntax support and does a great job on project-level analysis, refactor and find usage, and so on.

1. Very slow code syntax checking and compilation
2. No error prompts
3. Reports errors on correct code, even when compilation succeeds
4. Auto-completion is extremely slow
5. Terrible user experience—this plugin feels practically useless

Very poor import suggestion detection (especially for implicits), very slow on code transformations. Very often laggy on code analysis (incorrect display of unused code etc.). Quite often shows code as invalid when it compiles correctly.
